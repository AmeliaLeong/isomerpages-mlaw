Queries under other law-related agencies
---

<p style="text-align: justify">In the course of our dealings with the public, the Ministry of Law often receives queries related to the Judiciary, in particular the Family Court and the Small Claims Tribunals, as well as requests for legal advice.

We have provided a listing of law-related agencies and their scope of services below:

<b>Subordinate Courts of Singapore</b>

The Subordinate Courts comprise the following:

* <b>District Courts</b> - Civil Court and Criminal Courts;

* <b>Magistrate's Courts</b> - Civil Court and Criminal Courts, and

<p style="text-align: justify">* **Specialised Courts** - Family Court, Juvenile Court, Coroner's Court, Traffic Court, Criminal Mentions Court, Filter Court, Centralised Sentencing Court, Night Criminal Mentions Court and Small Claims Tribunals. 

<b>Family Court</b>

The Family Court deals with all family proceedings in Singapore. Its jurisdiction covers:

* adoption proceedings under the Adoption of Children Act

* divorce, nullity and judicial separation proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter

<p style="text-align: justify">* guardianship, custody, care and control of and access to children under the Guardianship of Infants Act and Part X of the Women’s Charter

<b>Small Claims Tribunal</b>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Small Claims Tribunals are part of the Subordinate Courts of Singapore. The Tribunals were established to provide a quick and inexpensive forum for the resolution of small claims between consumers and suppliers. The Tribunals have jurisdiction to hear claims not exceeding $10,000, where the claims relate to disputes arising from:

* a contract for the sale of goods; or

* a contract for the provision of services; or

* tortious damage to property (but not including damage arising in connection with motor vehicle accidents)

* any contract relating to a lease of residential premises not exceeding 2 years
