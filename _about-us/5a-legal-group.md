MinLaw ensures a sound and progressive legal framework that is relevant and modern, provides access to justice, and upholds the rule of law.

The Legal Group, comprising the Legal Policy Division, International Legal Division and Policy Advisory Division, regularly reviews laws, proposes law reforms, and pursues new initiatives to strengthen the legal infrastructure. Such work covers a wide spectrum ranging from domestic civil law and criminal law, to public international law.
