Alternatives for Working in the Legal Field in Singapore

If you are not [eligible for admission to the Singapore Bar](http://www.sile.edu.sg/admission-to-the-singapore-bar), you may wish to consider alternatives for working in the legal field in Singapore, including:

**(A) Practising Foreign Law as a Foreign Lawyer**

If you are registered to practise law in an overseas jurisdiction, you can register with the [Legal Services Regulatory Authority](#){:target="_blank"} as a foreign lawyer under [Part IXA of the Legal Profession Act](#) to practise foreign law in Singapore. You will not need to take any courses or examinations. 

**(B) Practising in Permitted Areas of Singapore Law as a Foreign Practitioner**

Foreign-qualified lawyers who pass the [Foreign Practitioner Examinations](http://www.sile.edu.sg/foreign-practitioner-examinations) (FPE) can register with the [Legal Services Regulatory Authority](#){:target="_blank"} as a foreign practitioner under Section 36B of the Legal Profession Act to practise in permitted areas of Singapore law.  Please refer to the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE)’s [website](http://www.sile.edu.sg/) for more details on the FPE.

**(C) Working as In-House Counsel**

You may be able to work as in-house counsel in an organisation in Singapore. For more information, please refer to the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association’s [website](https://www.scca.org.sg/).

You can apply for a place on an approved law degree programme at the [National University of Singapore](https://law.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), the [Singapore Management University](https://law.smu.edu.sg/) (SMU) or the [Singapore University of Social Sciences](https://www.suss.edu.sg/law-programmes) (SUSS). 

If you are currently employed, the SUSS School of Law’s curriculum is credit-based and modular, with classes conducted in the evenings to cater to working students.  

**(E) Exemption by the Minister for Law**

If you are not eligible for admission to the Singapore Bar, you may wish to try submitting an application to the Minister for Law for an [exemption](admission-to-the-bar/applications-to-the-minister-for-law-for-exemption/).

Please note that each application for an exemption will be considered on its individual merits and may be granted subject to conditions. The onus is on the applicant to make a strong case for the exemption sought.
