AS a Senior Corporate Insolvency Executive with the Ministry of Law’s (Min- Law) Corporate Insolvency Division (CID), Ms Sharizah Shariff, 37, has seen former millionaires break down in front of her.

 

“As part of my job, I have to explain to a company’s directors or an organisation’s office bearers why we need to liquidate their company or organisation, and why they need to surrender all the assets and documents to the Official Receiver,” she explained.

 

“They can be rather emotional, as it means that all their hard work in building up the company or organisation was for naught. In times like these, I just need to lend them a listening ear as they grieve over the loss.”

 

She remains calm and professional even when company directors or office bearers become upset or defensive — a valuable skill acquired in her 18 years with MinLaw, where she started as a companies liquidation officer.

 

Ms Shariff was recruited only two weeks after sitting for the final exams of her Diploma in Banking and Finance Services from Singapore Polytechnic in 1997.

 

“I’ve always been interested in numbers, and I initially had a desire to work in a bank. But I became interested in liquidation work in school, as it is considered part of banking services. When MinLaw offered me the job, I was up for it as it combines my professional interests with helping people.”
