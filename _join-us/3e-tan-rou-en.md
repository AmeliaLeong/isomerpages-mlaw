Having a heart for the needy

**MS TAN** Rou’en had always wanted a job that would enable her to help others.

So when she heard of an opening at the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB), under the Ministry of Law (MinLaw), she applied for it immediately. Little did she know what she was in for.

LAB provides legal service for the less privileged.

 

 

 

The 31-year-old recalls: “During the interview, the then-LAB director Tan Puay Boon gave me a reality check. He told me that the bureau’s work involves heavy caseloads, and could also get emotionally draining as some of the applicants are in very difficult circumstances.”

 

Mr Tan’s grim revelation made her hesitate, but when a friend in the legal sector who was familiar with LAB’s work told her about the bureau’s good working environment and that staff were happy there, she decided to go with her heart.
