Approval to Share Premises
---

A law practice that wishes to share, occupy or use premises jointly with another law practice, or an entity that is not a law practice, must ensure that it:

* Preserves its professional independence, by keeping itself separate and distinct from the other entity;
* Is clearly identified as separate and distinct from the other entity;  
* Safeguards its clientsâ€™ confidential information by preventing unauthorised access by the other entity; and
* Complies with the rules governing law practices as set out in the [Legal Profession Act and its subsidiary legislation](/law-practice-entities-and-lawyers/resources-for-law-practice-entities/relevant-legislation-and-communications/){:target="_blank"}.

This webpage sets out common scenarios where the prior approval in writing of the Director of Legal Services is required and/or where an update application to LSRA needs to be submitted.  This guide is not intended to be legal advice and should not be relied on as such.  It also does not purport to be complete or up to date.  Law practices remain responsible for their own compliance.

Where Approval is Required

The prior approval in writing of the Director of Legal Services is required if certain entities (Entity 1) wish to share, occupy or use premises jointly with other entities (Entity 2). Please refer to rule 81 of the [Legal Profession (Law Practice Entities) Rules 2015](/law-practice-entities-and-lawyers/resources-for-law-practice-entities/relevant-legislation-and-communications/){:target="_blank"}.
