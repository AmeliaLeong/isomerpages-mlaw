On 28 February 2018, the Ministry of Law will table in Parliament wide-ranging amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act.
 
The proposed amendments include the introduction of video-recording of interviews (VRI). This will assist the Courts to try cases more effectively by taking into account the intervieweeâ€™s demeanour, and providing an objective contemporaneous account of the interview.
 
For more information on VRI and its implementation, please refer to this video.
