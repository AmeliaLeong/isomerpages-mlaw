**Legal Services and Education** 

<ol>
<li>I thank the MPs who have spoken. I will respond to Members' comments on
<ul>
<li>Liberalisation of the legal practice; </li>
<li>Legal Education changes; </li>
<li>Admission to the Singapore Bar; </li>
<li>Solicitors holding clients' monies; and </li>
<li>Whether voting is a right or privilege, and whether it should be expressly mentioned in the Constitution </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

**Singapore as a legal services and education hub**


{:start="2"}
2. Members have raised important points and I thank them. In the context of the liberalisation and legal education, our aim is to make Singapore a legal hub. And we need a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework. In that context, we will make the following significant moves:


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>A vibrant legal services sector </u></li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Liberalisation - QFLPs </li>
</ol>


{:start="3"}
3. First of all, in respect of creating a vibrant legal services sector, last December we granted Qualifying Foreign Law Practice (QFLP) licences to six foreign law firms.


{:start="4"}
4. The six firms are top-notch and internationally renowned. They will complement and enhance the legal services provided in Singapore.

<li>Developing Singapore as an International Commercial Arbitration Hub 
</li>
</ol>

{:start="5"}
5. We have also built upon our geographic advantages to become an arbitration venue of choice.

{:start="6"}
6. By mid-2009, we will have Maxwell Chambers - a conservation building renovated to house a first-class venue for international arbitration hearings.

<ol start="7">
<li>It will have state-of-the-art facilities, including:

<ul>
<li>verbatim recording; </li>
<li>transcribing of witness testimony; and </li>
<li>instantaneous translations. </li> 
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
<li>This is not an isolated effort. It is part of a series of concerted measures to build up our arbitration sector.

<ul>
<li>For example, the American Arbitration Association entered into a joint venture with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in 2006 to pursue regional opportunities. </li>
<li>The Permanent Court of Arbitration is now in Singapore. </li>
<li>The International Chamber of Commerce - International Court of Arbitration (ICC ICA) will set up a regional office here in Singapore. </li>
<li>SIAC and SIAC clauses are gaining ground internationally, and, in tandem with their profile, their outlook will have to become increasingly international.</li>

</ul>

</li>
</ol>


{:start="9"}
9. Our status as a top class arbitration centre is recognised internationally. A 2007 report published by the ICC International Court of Arbitration ranked Singapore as the top city in Asia for ICC arbitrations and one of the five most popular arbitration venues since 2000, alongside Paris, London, Geneva and Zurich.


{:start="10"}
10. Our advantage is our connectivity and world class infrastructure, our judicial philosophy in respect of arbitrations and being accessible at a much lower expense than some of the other popular arbitration centres.


{:start="11"}
11. Internationally renowned arbitrators have begun to base their regional arbitration practices in Singapore. Both local and international law firms in Singapore report brisk growth in their arbitration practices. These firms will benefit from our tax incentives for growth in these areas.
