1. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move “That the Bill be now read a Second time”.

2. This Bill, Sir, repeals and re-enacts the Criminal Procedure Code, hereafter referred to as the CPC. 

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight: bold;">
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>

{:start="3"}
3. The CPC sets out the procedures to be observed in the conduct of criminal cases in Singapore. It is a fundamental part of our Criminal Justice System.


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Philosophy underpinning our Approach</li>
</ol>



{:start="4"}
4. Sir, the key principles underlying the approach we take in shaping the Criminal Justice System include the following:

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u> Presumption of Innocence</u></li>
</ol>


{:start="5"}
5. Every person is presumed innocent. One is guilty only upon conviction by a Court.

{:start="6"}
6. While we have specific exceptions in the law to this approach, the presumption of innocence is fundamental. 



<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>The procedure must be fair</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="7"}
7. The procedure that is set out must be fair.


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>The procedure must reasonably provide for arriving at the truth</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="8"}
8. The procedure must provide a system for arriving at the truth.

{:start="9"}
9. That means that it should not be a system that leans towards conviction regardless of innocence or guilt. But it should also not be a system which gives the offender every possible technicality to escape conviction.


<ol start="10">
<li> Each society seeks to strike a balance between:

<ol>
<li>the rights of society, to secure conviction of a  person who commits an offence; and </li>
<li>the rights of an individual, not to be wrongly convicted. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="11"}
11. These amendments seek to strike the balance in a fair way. I will admit freely that there can be reasonable debate as to whether that balance has been rightly struck. There will be people who will disagree with the proposals. The procedure to be adopted for administration of criminal justice is an area where there are diverse and often contentious viewpoints. This is an evolutionary process and we will have to continue to be open to amending our criminal procedures to meet changing norms.


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold">
<li> Consultation</li>
</ol>


{:start="12"}
12. In our efforts to achieve the correct balance that I referred to, we engaged in extensive consultations.

{:start="13"}
13. The draft Bill was first issued in December 2008. The public were invited to give their comments. There were several responses.

{:start="14"}
14. We then formed a working group, comprising representatives from relevant government agencies, the Singapore Law Society, the Association of Criminal Lawyers Singapore, faculty members from the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Management University, as well as other legal practitioners. The Working Group was tasked to examine the proposals which were received by my Ministry in the course of public consultations. Table top exercises were conducted by the working group to iron out the various procedures which were to be introduced by this Bill. After the working group had completed their discussions, my Ministry, together with its partner agencies, continued to review and deliberate on various aspects of the Bill in light of the points raised by the working group.

<ol start="15">
<li>Each and every proposal has been given due consideration. Several proposals were adopted. For instance:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>the accused’s whole statements (instead of only portions of those statements) would be provided by the Prosecution in discovery;</li>
<li>the Preliminary Inquiry process was retained;</li>
<li>the concept of using “oppression” as the touchstone for determining the voluntariness, and hence admissibility, of an accused person’s confession was codified and even extended to all forms of statements.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="16"}
16. Of course, not all suggestions could be taken on board. On a number of points the various members of the Working Group had to agree to disagee, but this was after a healthy and robust discussion of various points of view and concerns. This is best summed up by what the ACLS, through its President Mr Subhas Anandan, has told us, and I quote “ACLS had made written submissions to the Ministry of Law during public consultations on the proposed amendments to the CPC. Although the CPC Bill which had its first reading in Parliament on 26 April this year did not accept many of its recommendations, ACLS is pleased to note the introduction of the Criminal Case Discovery Procedure in the CPC Bill. The Disclosure Procedure requires the Prosecution to give to the Defence, apart from the charge, a summary of facts, a list of witnesses and exhibits and the statements to be adduced at the trial. This is a welcome change. ACLS also fully supports the introduction of the new community sentences in the Bill.”

{:start="17"}
17. The Working Group deserves our gratitude for helping us with this Bill. Its members are listed in the [Annex](#fn1) to my speech.

{:start="18"}
18. Let me now take Members through the key provisions.

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li> The Bill</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>Increased Jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Courts</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="19"}
19. Clause 7 of the Bill increases the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Courts to hear offences which carried a maximum term of imprisonment of three years to five years instead. The jurisdiction of the District Court and the High Court remains the same.


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>Private Prosecution</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="20"}
20. At present, the right of private prosecution is allowed in summary cases before a Magistrate’s Court, or for non-seizable cases before a District Court.

{:start="21"}
21. Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Courts is being expanded. It is therefore no longer appropriate to allow private prosecutions in respect of all cases triable before the Magistrates’ Courts. Neither is it appropriate to tie this to non-seizable offences: some of these offences are punishable with terms of imprisonment of up to seven years.

{:start="22"}
22. Hereafter, pursuant to Clause 11(10), private persons will be able to prosecute offences where the maximum punishment is less than three years’ imprisonment, or which are punishable by fine only. Private prosecutions will be tied to less serious offences where the punishments are less severe.


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u> Police Enforcement Powers</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="23"}
23. The Bill makes a number of amendments to rationalise Police enforcement powers. I will touch on two key changes: the seizure of property and police powers of intervention.
