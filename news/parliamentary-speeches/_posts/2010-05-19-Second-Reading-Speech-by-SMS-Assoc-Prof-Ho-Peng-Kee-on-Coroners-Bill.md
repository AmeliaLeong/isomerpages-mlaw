1. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”

2. The provisions on Coroner’s Inquiries are currently found in the Criminal Procedure Code or “CPC”. This Bill is a result of our review of the CPC. Like the CPC, public feedback was sought through a Consultation Paper on an earlier draft of the Bill over a period of four weeks last year. Useful feedback was received, some of which have been incorporated in the Bill now before the House.

3. In terms of presentation, other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia have also enacted standalone Coroner’s legislation. Substantively, the proposed changes will update our coronial system, more clearly defining its role and strengthening its procedures so that it will better serve the public interest.

4. This Bill contains three key proposals. First, the Bill changes the present fault-finding nature of a Coroner’s Inquiry to a fact-finding one. Second, the Bill widens the technical expertise available to the Coroner. Third, the Bill re-scopes the Coroner’s jurisdiction, giving it a clearer focus.
