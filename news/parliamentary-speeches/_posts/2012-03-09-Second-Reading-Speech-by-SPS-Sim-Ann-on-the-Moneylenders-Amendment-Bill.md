1. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”

2. Sir, I mentioned in this House earlier this week, that MinLaw is amending the moneylending legislations to further tighten regulation of the industry and better safeguard the interests of borrowers, in particular lower income borrowers. 

3. We are proposing amendments to the Moneylenders Act in this Bill. We have also made amendments to the Moneylenders Rules. Let me first take the House through the Bill.


<ol start="4">
<li>The Bill seeks to:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Strengthen the enforcement powers of the Registry of Moneylenders; </li>
<li>Safeguard borrowers’ information from unlicensed moneylenders; and </li>
<li>Clarify the provisions governing moneylenders’ place of business. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


**Strengthen the enforcement powers of the Registry of Moneylenders**

{:start="5"}
5. Sir, Section 25 sets out the Registry’s statutory powers to inspect the business premises of licensed moneylenders and to require them to furnish information and documents. Clause 4 amends Section 25 to allow the Registry to engage any person, for example, auxiliary police officers, to assist the Registrar or an authorised public officer in exercising the Registry’s statutory powers. While they will be able to view and make copies of documents being inspected, the power to seize and remove documents or equipment from the premises inspected will continue to be exercised by public officers only. The amendment will enhance the Registry’s capacity to conduct more frequent and thorough enforcement checks on moneylenders.



{:start="6"}
6. Clause 4 also amends Section 25 to give the Registry powers to specify the time, place and manner in which information or documents required by the Registry are to be furnished by the moneylender.

**Safeguard borrowers’ information from unlicensed moneylenders**

{:start="7"}
7. Section 14(1) creates the offence of unlicensed moneylending and Section 14(3)(A) stipulates a non-exhaustive list of activities which are deemed to be assisting in unlicensed moneylending. Such activities include allowing premises to be used for unlicensed moneylending, and collecting or demanding payment of a loan on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender. While the generality of Section 14(1) makes all activities which assist in unlicensed moneylending illegal, we propose to make it explicitly clear that it is a criminal offence to share information on borrowers with unlicensed moneylenders.  In this regard, Clause 3 amends Section 14(3A) to include the activity of any person sharing information on a potential borrower with an unlicensed moneylender, or referring a potential borrower to an unlicensed moneylender, as assisting in unlicensed moneylending . A person convicted of the offence will be liable for a fine of up to $300,000 and depending on whether it is the first or subsequent offence, a maximum of four or seven years’ imprisonment and a maximum of six or 12 strokes of the cane.


**Clarify the provisions governing moneylenders’ place of business**

{:start="8"}
8. Section 10(13)(a) makes it an offence for moneylenders to commence their business at a place which the Registry has not approved. Clause 2 amends Section 10(13)(a) to make it explicit that it is an offence for moneylenders to carry on their moneylending business at an unauthorised place of business, regardless of when it commenced.


**Background to Amendments to the Moneylenders Rules**

{:start="9"}
9. Sir, before I touch on the amendments we are making to the Moneylenders Rules, I will briefly explain the broad rationale for these amendments. Since the Moneylenders Act was amended in 2008, the moneylending industry has grown. We have been monitoring developments and tightened the moneylending regulations last year, through, amongst others, advertising directions and licence conditions.


<ol start="10">
<li>During the debates earlier this week, I briefly touched on the changes to the Moneylenders Rules to further strengthen protection for borrowers. I will now share with the House in greater detail these amendments , which cover four main areas:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Mandate the use of Effective Interest Rate. </li>
<li>Extend coverage of caps on interest rate, to a larger group of borrowers. </li>
<li>Remove certain fees from the list of fees which moneylenders are allowed to charge borrowers. </li>
<li>Abolish all exceptions to the limits on the amount of unsecured loans that a borrower can obtain. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
