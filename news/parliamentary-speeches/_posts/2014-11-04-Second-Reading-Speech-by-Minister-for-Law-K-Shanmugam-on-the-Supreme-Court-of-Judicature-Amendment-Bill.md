Madam Speaker,

1. I beg to move, ‘That the Bill be now read a second time’.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li><u>Introduction</u></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill (“the Bill”) introduces amendments in two main areas:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> First, it establishes the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”); and</li>
<li> Second, it refines the procedure for obtaining leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal in civil proceedings.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="3"}
3. I will take each set of amendments in turn.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li><u>Establishing the Singapore International Commercial Court</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. Madam Speaker, I have touched on the rationale and general framework for the SICC during the debate on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill.


{:start="5"}
5. I will therefore focus on the key features of the SICC that are found in this Bill.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Key Features of the SICC</li>
</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. The Bill establishes the SICC as a division of the High Court <a href="#court"><sup>1</sup></a>.


{:start="7"}
7. The President of the SICC shall be the Chief Justice, unless he appoints a Judge of Appeal, a Judge of the High Court, a Senior Judge or an International Judge to be the President <a href="#president"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<ol start="8">
<li>The SICC will have jurisdiction to hear cases that can be heard by the High Court in its original civil jurisdiction, and are international and commercial in nature 3.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The Rules of Court will set out the types of cases that are considered international and commercial in nature.</li>
<li>For certainty, potential parties will have the option of applying for a pre-action certificate to certify that the intended action is international and commercial in nature 4.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The pre-action certificate may also certify such other matters as the Rules of Court may prescribe.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In addition, cases commenced in the SICC may be transferred to the High Court, and vice versa 5.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>This enables cases which would be more appropriately heard in the other Court to be transferred.</li>
<li>The procedure and conditions for such transfer of cases will be set out in the Rules of Court.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="9">
<li>Proceedings in the SICC will be heard either by a single Judge or by 3 Judges <a href="#judges"><sup>6</sup></a>.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Where proceedings are heard by 3 Judges, the Chief Justice shall appoint one of the Judges to preside.</li>
<li>The case will be decided in accordance with the decision of the majority <a href="#majority"><sup>7</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
