Madam Speaker,


1. I beg to move, ‘That the Bill be now read a Second time’.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li><u> Introduction</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="2"}
2. As mentioned in my speech to introduce the Mediation Bill, Singapore is well poised to strengthen its position as a leading centre for cross-border dispute resolution. We will make a number of moves this year to grow dispute resolution work in Singapore to the next level. I will now set out the context for the Civil Law (Amendment) Bill.

<ol start="3">
<li>Compared to international commercial mediation, international commercial arbitration in Singapore is more developed.  

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> Our International Arbitration Act was introduced in 1994 and has been updated from time to time, to be on the cutting-edge of international arbitration.</li>
<li> The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is now amongst the top five most preferred arbitral institutions in the world. It set a record in 2015 for the number of new cases and dispute quantum. I am confident that in 2016, SIAC would have done even better. I look forward to a new record.

</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

4. Singapore is now one of the top five most preferred seats of arbitration in the world, alongside London, Paris, Geneva and Hong Kong. But we are not resting on our laurels. We will need to stay responsive to business and constantly adapt what we do to better serve their needs.

{:start="5"}
5. One area where we can do so is in third-party funding in international commercial arbitration, where legal costs can be substantial and where there is today a growing body of reputable professional funders.  


<ol start="6">
<li>There are two main aspects to third-party funding:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, as the name suggests, third-party funding involves the funding of a claim by a party who is unconnected to the dispute. The party, usually the claimant, uses the funds to cover its legal costs in the dispute.</li>
<li>Second, in return for the funds, the funder usually receives a share of the damages awarded if the claim succeeds. If the claim fails, the claimant does not have to repay the funder. This is the risk that the funder takes.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
<li>  Currently, in Singapore, agreements for third-party funding of dispute resolution proceedings are generally unenforceable as they fall foul of the laws of maintenance and champerty.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Maintenance is the provision of assistance to a party by a person or entity that has no interest in the proceedings.</li>
<li>Champerty is maintenance of an action in return for a share in the proceeds of the action. </li>
</ol>
 
 
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
<li>There are two aspects of champerty and maintenance.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>There is a common law tort of champerty and maintenance.</li>
<li>Also, under contract law, agreements affected by maintenance or champerty are void as contrary to public policy.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
