INTRODUCTION

1. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the members for contributing to this debate, and also for sharing our vision that access to justice must be a cornerstone of our legal system.
 
2. And I also thank the very many volunteer lawyers, pro bono lawyers – like Mr Murali Pillai, who is an Assigned Solicitor for LAB – because these people, apart from the rules and regulations that we make, these lawyers, with their pro bono work, contribute to the richness of making justice accessible to even the most disadvantaged in Singapore.
 
3. Now there are several queries on the Bill and I would like to jump straight into addressing them.
 
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>APPLICATION FIGURES</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the number of legal aid applications,

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In the past 10 years, LAB received a total of approximately 97,100 applications. Of these, 88,800, or more than 90%, passed the preliminary means test. </li>
 
<li>In general, applicants who were unsuccessful had failed the eligibility criteria because they exceeded the disposable income or capital assets limits. </li>
 
<li>Around half of LAB’s cases concern matrimonial matters. Other common cases concern the enforcement of court orders, monetary disputes, and also probate.</li> 
</ol>


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li> NEW MEANS CRITERIA AND RELATED LIMITS/ COVERAGE</li>
</ol>

{:start="5"}
5. Let me address now the questions about the new means criteria and limits. Mr Henry Kwek asked about the assessment, while Mr Chris de Souza and Mr Murali Pillai asked about the qualifying limits and how they would be set. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked whether CPF moneys would be included in the assessment of the applicant’s savings and investment, and Mr Murali also asked whether CPF contributions would be included in the assessment of the applicant’s income. Mr Murali also asked if there is a need for additional resources to be provided to MinLaw to administer the new means criteria.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>MinLaw will adopt the Per Capita Household Income (PCHI) and the Annual Value (AV) of the applicant’s place of residence, savings, and investments as the new criteria to replace the current disposable income and current disposable capital criteria. The new criteria are simpler, and much more aligned with what are commonly used by or in current social support schemes. </li>
 
<li>The new means criteria consider the applicants’ gross income and assets, instead of his disposable income and disposable capital. We will incorporate most of the permitted deductibles within the current means criteria, such as CPF contributions, when setting the new income limits in the new assessment criteria, to minimise the risk that those applicants who were previously eligible would no longer be eligible when we move from disposable income to the gross income. </li>
 
<li>We will not include the applicants’ CPF moneys in the computation of the applicant’s savings and investment. This is also consistent with our existing means test.  </li>
 
<li>The qualifying limit for the new means criteria will be set later in subsidiary legislation, as I said earlier, to take into account the 2018 income data, but it will be set at a level where there will be no material impact on the number of households who will remain eligible for legal aid, and it will be set at a level which would ensure that a similar level of households at present, which is approximately 25%, will be maintained. </li>
 
<li>Next, we do not anticipate, at this point in time, a significant spike in the number of cases that come forward, and hence my point earlier about the allocation of Government resources. So it will be managed. My Ministry will allocate the appropriate resources to deal with any increased caseload as they arise, but bear in mind also that the amendments do provide for Specialised Legal Executives to come on board, to lend to the giving of advice and also to appear in Court for some of these cases. So that will also ease the load on the existing LAB. </li>
</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. Mr Gan asked if the use of household income would disadvantage applicants who need to support family members staying in a different household. In other words, what Mr Gan was saying is if I look at only the household income of this individual, it may not give me a full picture because he may be supporting a family member residing in a different household.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We do not consider family members living in a different household in calculating the PCHI, because family relationships can be complex and diverse. The situation that Mr Gan cited could well work the other way – where an applicant could be supported by a family member not living in the same household. In other words, he is coming to apply, based on his PCHI he would qualify, but yet he is also being supported by a family member living outside of his household. The Government is not privy to the family dynamics in each situation and so it is best at this stage to use the household income as the best proxy for family support. </li>
<li>Furthermore, this will also be more convenient for applicants, as they will not have to provide information on family members that do not live with them and the extent of their support and the extent of that familial relationship, whatever that may be as well. So, at present we will keep using the per capita household income. </li>
<li>Now given this, we will adopt the per capita household income as I said, although I would stress that in appropriate cases we would also be able to consider the scenario that Mr Gan mentioned, where it is just and proper to do so. And that is precisely the reason for the framework that we are building into the new amendments, where if it is just and proper, then the Minister may, at discretion, allow aid to be granted. And so, to take the example a bit further, if the applicant is the sole source of support for that family member, and the family member is not a beneficiary of other government schemes, those are factors that can be taken into account. </li>
</ol>

{:start="7"}
7. Mr Louis Ng had asked whether the Ministry is tracking the legal costs and the proportion of households for whom legal representation remains accessible, and whether we would consider increasing the coverage for civil legal aid. Ms Rahayu also asked if there could be adjustments to the limits to allow more to qualify for legal aid.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>I assure members that MinLaw regularly reviews the means test for civil legal aid, taking into account legal costs, the cost of living, and other factors, to ensure that legal aid remains accessible to Singapore Citizens and also Permanent Residents of limited means who cannot afford their own lawyers. </li>
<li>Legal aid is targeted and given only to those with limited means, as it has to be, because we have limited resources and we need to be prudent about how we allocate them. In the most recent review leading up to this Bill, we had taken into account these factors in deciding to retain the coverage at the present levels. And as I mentioned earlier, at this level, approximately 25% of households are covered. </li>
</ol>

{:start="8"}
8. Mr Gan asked if we could consider negative net worth as part of the means assessment, if the applicant’s debt liabilities exceed his assets. And Mr Murali also asked on a related note if we would consider circumstances where families are put into significant expense as a result of intervening events.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We do not generally exclude liabilities, such as debts, when we assess an applicant’s means. </li>
<li>I think what Mr Gan has in mind is if you are servicing or have taken out a loan which may be secured, and where the security value may be below the value of the loan that has been taken, whether that can be taken into account. And the reason we do not do that is because the applicant may have secured debt liabilities, for example a mortgage or a car loan, which is quite common, but may still possess savings or income above the means limits, and this may then allow him to afford legal fees. He would not be considered in that situation a person of limited means. However, if that person or the applicant has liquidated his savings and investments to pay off the debts, and thereafter remains in a financial situation as would allow him to come within the means criteria, then yes that person will be considered for assistance. </li>
<li>We will also consider an indebted individual with extenuating circumstances on a case-by-case basis, and may grant aid where it is just and proper to do so. So for example, if the debt was incurred due to a significant expense as a result of an intervening event, as Mr Murali puts it, for example a serious acute medical condition, then yes, those are circumstances that will be taken into account as well in the assessment. </li>
</ol>

{:start="9"}
9. At the same time, whilst we are not expanding the coverage or considering the negative net worth and family members living in a different household when assessing means, the Bill, as I said earlier, does provide for greater flexibility and discretion for aid to be granted to deserving applicants. This will allow us to provide aid in a more targeted manner, which would also achieve greater equity.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha" >
<li>PROVIDING GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO GRANT AID</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"}
10. Now this brings me to the questions from Mr Chris de Souza, Mr Henry Kwek, and Mr Murali who asked how this flexibility could be exercised. Mr Murali asked in particular what are the circumstances in which it would be “just and proper” to grant aid. I think I have given a sense of what that might be in my earlier paragraph. Ms Rahayu also asked if we can consider extenuating circumstances, for example children or relatives staying in the same household but not contributing to the household income, or applicants who stay in private properties due to their circumstances, in our computation of the PCHI or Annual Value.


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The intention behind the amendments and the regime that has been set in place with the amendments in this Bill is of course to allow for a more flexible assessment to be made in order that aid can be granted if the Minister is of the opinion that it would be just and proper to do so. The key words being ‘just and proper’, and we want to retain that flexibility on a case-by-case basis because each case will be different, the circumstances that present for each applicant may be different, and we want to have the flexibility to be able to assess these factors on a case-by-case basis. </li>
<li>When such cases arise, the Minister may authorise any person, and that includes a panel of persons, suitably qualified, to make that assessment. </li>
<li>In exercising the discretion, we may consider granting aid to an applicant who might otherwise fail the means criteria but still not be able to afford legal services due to extenuating circumstances, those that we mentioned, Mr Murali gave some examples and Ms Rahayu as well.  We will also consider if family members staying in the same household cannot contribute to the individual’s legal costs, so for example, children is one example, the other would be where the family members living in the same household may be estranged from each other. I do not want to be taken in my answer to be limiting the circumstances in which we consider that, so I do stress that it is on a case-by-case basis and looking at the particular facts of each case as they present. </li>
<li>Applicants who fail the means criteria will be informed of the reason. Applicants who may then have extenuating circumstances can bring this up to the Minister under the procedure. It is not a statutory appeal. At this point in time we are working out the operational details and also the procedural steps necessary for this to be highlighted, but it will not be treated as a statutory appeal. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>HELPING APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY</li>
</ol>

{:start="11"}
11. Mr Gan asked if the Ministry can consider alternative sources of assistance to applicants who do not qualify for legal aid and fail the means test, and the example Mr Gan gave was to ask solicitors to grant a deferment payment scheme for legal fees.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Now, Government assistance is generally given to those most vulnerable and those most in need of assistance, and that is what the current regime for means criteria seeks to achieve. </li>
 
<li>If an applicant satisfies this criteria, plus the merits test, he will be given legal aid. But if the applicant does not satisfy the criteria but goes on nonetheless to engage a lawyer, we will be unable to mandate that there be a deferment payment scheme for such services, which are really between the individual as the client and his solicitor. But this,  not being able to do it by legislation, does not stop a client from requesting his lawyers to consider either an instalment scheme or a deferred payment scheme as may be appropriate. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>  IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATION OF LEGAL AID</li>
</ol>


{:start="12"} 
12. Next, we will also be making various improvements to the administration of legal aid.

{:start="13"} 
13. Mr de Souza asked for an elaboration of the rigorous training that public officers who are not qualified persons under the Legal Profession Act will undergo, in order to appear and plead in Court for an aided person. Mr Henry Kwek asked if MinLaw would decide what cases these public officers would take on, and whether this would compromise the interest of aided persons. The LAB will ensure the thorough and proper training of such persons and will ensure that no aided persons’ interests will be compromised as a result of the use of such public officers.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The LAB’s Legal Executives are well-trained and they do complement the work of the Legal Officers. </li>
<li>Currently, Legal Executives already perform a significant amount of work at LAB, and this includes taking of instructions and preparing drafts of certain documents. And we feel that many of them are capable of doing more and can be made to do more. </li>
<li>So we will allow our best Legal Executives to be appointed by the Director to provide legal advice and also represent applicants in Court proceedings and at mediation. </li>
<li>All appointed Specialist Legal Executives will have to attend legal knowledge courses on relevant subject areas to the kind of work that they do, so it will be in areas such as divorce, mediation, the Singapore Legal System, professional skills, and of course, legal writing. These courses will be provided by both external providers, as well as through the in-house legal expertise which already exists at LAB. </li>
<li>They will have to go through a practical training program, which will cover skills such as drafting, client-management/ client-facing work, court etiquette and so on. They will be accompanied by in-house supervision by experienced legal officers and assessments made, before they are allowed to attend court and represent clients. </li>
<li>This training will ensure that the Specialist Legal Executives will be well-equipped to handle the expanded scope of work, so that LAB’s clients’ interests will be effectively represented. </li>
<li>Even then, for a start, we intend to limit the cases where such officers will take up to simple uncontested divorce proceedings where the matrimonial assets are $1 million or less, as a starting point. </li>
<li>If the matters that these officers are handling become subsequently contested or more challenging, they will be handed over to a lawyer, who will take over the matter.  We will continually review the role of the Specialist Legal Executive to consider what more they can do.  This will no doubt ease the burden, and bring down costs overall as well as allowing for cases to be managed more expeditiously, as I mentioned earlier. </li>
</ol>

{:start="14"}
14. Mr Kwek asked about the rationale for allowing the Director, instead of the Legal Aid Board, to grant aid for straightforward matters. Mr Kwek asked if we could avoid the Director being a bottleneck.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Currently, at this point in time, the merits of all applications are assessed by the Legal Aid Board which comprises the Legal Aid Director and not fewer than two solicitors from a panel of solicitors maintained under the Act. And the Board meets once fortnightly. </li>
<li>This means that after LAB has prepared a legal opinion for an applicant, the applicant may have to wait for up to two weeks before aid is granted, or deferred, or refused. </li>
<li>Allowing the Director in such cases to grant aid for straightforward matters will help and not hinder, the applicant’s case by up to two weeks, as the Director can now immediately determine whether in that case, aid should be granted or not, assuming the means criteria is satisfied, without waiting for the Board to convene. </li>
<li>The discretion, however, will only be exercised in straightforward matters, such as uncontested matters relating to Probate, Letters of Administration, and Guardianship matters where the Defendants consent to the proceedings. Any application for which aid may be refused will still go through the Legal Aid Board. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>OTHER CLARIFICATIONS</li>
</ol>

{:start="15"}
15. Let me just wrap up with a few of the other clarifications which Members have raised.

{:start="16"}
16. Mr Henry Kwek asked whether Permanent Residents were subject to a more stringent set of criteria in our assessment on whether they qualify for civil legal aid.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The criteria will be the same, but Permanent Residents will generally be charged a higher contribution towards the costs incurred for their case, if they are granted legal aid.</li>
</ol>

{:start="17"}
17. Mr Louis Ng asked why aided persons have to go through fresh means test and merits test when appealing a decision for a case where aid was previously granted, and for a case where the aided person subsequently wishes to enforce the judgment. Mr Ng also asked whether the Minister would consider an expedited process for assessing whether to extend aid to an aided person who wishes to file an appeal, given that strict timelines do apply in the context of when an appeal is brought.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We require aided persons to go through a fresh means and merits tests because considerable time may have elapsed between the time the person first applied for legal aid and was granted, and the completion of his initial matter. The means may have changed during this period of time. </li>
<li>And as Mr Ng also acknowledged, the merits may also have changed, given that the proceedings have taken place, evidence may have been given and a judgement may have been issued on the case. So a fresh merits test is also necessary to ensure that we continue to grant aid only to those most deserving – this includes those that are applying or seeking a meritorious outcome, and this includes for an appeal.  No doubt, when a second merits test is involved, when one is making an assessment on the same matter but given the lapse of time, the time taken for that assessment will no doubt be quicker. Circumstances in such a case however which may affect the merits of bringing or resisting an appeal, or in enforcing a judgment, may have changed, and it would be useful to have regard to this, in a fresh merits evaluation, to ensure that the grant of aid still remains appropriate. </li>
<li>I would also like to assure the Member that where an applicant requires aid as a matter of urgency, for example, when an appeal is due to be filed, the Director may issue a Grant of Aid on a provisional basis, if the Director is of the view that the applicant is likely to satisfy the means test and is likely to have a reasonable ground for appealing against the decision. </li>
<li>This Grant is typically valid for a period of three months, and can be further extended if necessary. Under the Provisional Grant of Aid, the Bureau may assist the aided person with the filing of the Notice of Appeal. In addition, the Director can also issue a notification under Section 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act to stay the proceedings for a period of 14 days whilst this is being done. </li>
</ol>

{:start="18"}
18. Mr Murali asked if the Ministry has considered Mr Hri Kumar’s suggestion back in 2013 for the Government to introduce a Public Defender Scheme to help indigent citizens who face criminal proceedings.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Since 2015, the Government has provided close to $6 million of funding support to the Law Society Pro Bono Services which run the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”). CLAS in turn assigns lawyers to accused persons who have been charged with a crime and who cannot afford hiring a lawyer. </li>
<li>So in this way, this has resulted in expanded assistance to criminal defence cases, as CLAS has been able to assist almost four times as many applicants in 2017, compared to pre-2015 before the funding was made available. </li>
</ol>

{:start="19"}
19. Mr Irshad asked if we can equip micro enterprises with the legal resources such as business contract templates. This would no doubt simplify process and the way in which legal services may be delivered on simple matters, but it is probably more appropriate for the Law Society to take this on, and we will consult with the Law Society Pro Bono Service Office and other volunteer groups to see if we can provide micro enterprises with such assistance.


<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li> PROVIDING HOLISTIC SUPPORT</li>
</ol>

{:start="20"}
20. I will end off by highlighting the holistic help – some Members have asked about it, in particular Mr Patrick Tay, that LAB and its partners have been giving to legal aid recipients who have more than just legal needs. This addresses Mr Tay’s questions about giving help to families in need, and also Mr Irshad’s question on public education and what more can be done to bring awareness of these schemes to the public’s attention.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Members would know that the Ministry works with partners such as the Law Society and the Community Justice Centre to raise awareness of the law and avenues of legal help, for example, through pamphlets that are produced and also the annual Law Awareness Weeks. </li>
<li>The Law Awareness Weeks, which just took place a few weeks ago, has expanded from one which lasts just one afternoon on one weekend, to one that lasts six weeks and is held at various locations across Singapore, and this helps to bring awareness of the offerings that pro bono lawyers working with Law Society can offer to the community. </li>
<li>Since 2016, LAB has also established referral protocols for family violence victims with PAVE, and with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, for those with social service needs, such as housing problems, family dysfunction and also addiction issues. LAB is working with other agencies, such as Biglove and Hearts @ Feiyue for applicants with child protection issues. The referral protocols allow LAB to refer applicants who require other social services to these agencies for help. Conversely, the agencies may refer applicants who require legal services to LAB for legal help as well, so it works both ways. </li>
<li>The referrals have helped a number of individuals and I would just like to highlight a few examples. </li>
<li>For one such referral, the applicant had applied for aid for his divorce proceedings. His wife was verbally and physically abusive to the family on a daily basis, which had a negative impact on the children. LAB when they came to know about this, referred the case to PAVE, worked with PAVE to make arrangements to assign a social worker to the Applicant, and also to give counselling to him and his family. </li>
<li>In another case, an 80-year-old applicant had a Personal Protection order (PPO) and a partial Domestic Exclusion Order against his adult son who was violent to him, and this allowed the son to occupy only one room of the flat. However, his son continued to use violence against him and during one quarrel, his son pushed him on his chest, causing him to hit his back and fracture his rib. LAB was aware of this and immediately referred him to PAVE, a family violence specialist agency; and worked with a nearby Senior Activity Centre near the applicant’s flat to set up a community watch for this individual. PAVE then subsequently also worked with LAB to support the applicant through the court process. LAB eventually successfully obtained the full Domestic Exclusion Order for the applicant. </li>
<li>Where relevant, LAB proactively assists vulnerable victims and applicants to protect their legal rights. For example, if an applicant applies only for assistance in divorce proceedings, but when they come to LAB and LAB officers detect that there may also be family violence involved, then LAB will consider if it would be appropriate for him or her to also commence PPO proceedings or other such measures, and assist with those applications. If the order involves the maintenance of wife and children, we will also inform the applicant how he or she can enforce the order if the other party does not comply with the order. </li>
</ol>

CONCLUSION

{:start="21"}
21. So I hope I have dealt with all the queries that have been raised. I would just like to make a few remarks in conclusion.

{:start="22"}
22. First, to thank the Members’ support for the Bill. The Bill will allow LAB to continue its good work. As you know, LAB is in its 60th year this year. 

<ol start="23">
<li>LAB’s work is simplified by:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, simplifying the means criteria which makes the process quicker, easier and also fairer; </li>
<li>Second, it provides more flexibility for aid to be given to those who might fail the means criteria, but nonetheless still cannot afford legal services for a number of reasons; and </li>
<li>Finally, improving the overall administration of legal aid. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="24"}
24. This is part and parcel of MinLaw’s efforts to ensure that legal representation remains accessible for the general public, and in particular, the most vulnerable of persons.

<ol start="25">
<li>But beyond legal aid, MinLaw is also committed to ensuring that the legal process is made simple and that access to justice in other forms will be enhanced, by:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, we enhance the family justice system that centres on the welfare of the child and the family, through the Family Justice Review Committee established with the MSF and the Courts. </li>
 
<li>Second, we are also looking at substantive reforms in civil law, to keep legal costs affordable, to reduce the complexity of civil proceedings, and to strengthen the enforcement of civil judgments. </li>
 
<li>Finally, we also enhance frameworks that enable Singaporeans to resolve their disputes quickly and cost-effectively, and where possible, as amicably as they possibly can in the circumstances. So we have built up the infrastructure for mediation to take place; community mediation has been happening for a while. We have also raised the claims limits for the Small Claims Tribunal from $10,000 to $20,000, so as to allow more to benefit from this quick and relatively inexpensive forum. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="26"}
26. Finally, as I said at the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the various contributions from so many community partners and the legal fraternity – including the Assigned Solicitors and volunteer lawyers – all of whom have made LAB’s work more rich and more satisfying in the last 60 years. We thank them for their continued support, and we will continue to work closely with the legal fraternity to provide access to justice to persons with limited means through pro bono efforts or low bono efforts, and assess how we may better recognise lawyers for these efforts, as Ms Rahayu had suggested.

{:start="27"}
27. Thank you.
