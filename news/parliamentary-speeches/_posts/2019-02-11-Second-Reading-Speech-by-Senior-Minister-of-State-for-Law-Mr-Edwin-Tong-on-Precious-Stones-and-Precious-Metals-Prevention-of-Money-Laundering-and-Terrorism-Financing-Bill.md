Mr Speaker,

1. I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a second time.”


**<u>INTRODUCTION</u>**

{:start="2"}
2. Singapore takes a firm stance against money laundering and terrorism financing, or “ML/TF”.

{:start="3"}
3. In 1992, we joined the Financial Action Task Force, which is an inter-governmental body that sets international standards and promotes the effective implementation of measures, to combat ML/TF and the financing of proliferation activities relating to weapons of mass destruction. 

{:start="4"}
4. We have implemented a strong anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, or “AML/CFT”, framework, in line with the international standards set by the Task Force. This includes the prevention, supervision, enforcement, confiscation of proceeds of crime, and targeted financial sanctions against terrorism and proliferation financing.

{:start="5"}
5. The financial sector and non-financial sectors, such as casinos and pawnbrokers are subject to a comprehensive range of AML/CFT measures. The financial sector in particular, has been subject to robust supervision for many years.

{:start="6"}
6. ML/TF enables criminal activity to go undetected and poses serious national security concerns. It also damages our reputation as a trusted international financial and trading centre. A robust AML/CFT framework would therefore benefit Singapore and Singaporeans.

**<u>CURRENT AML/CFT MEASURES IN THE PSMD SECTOR</u>**

{:start="7"}
7. In line with the broader AML/CFT framework, we have introduced various measures to mitigate ML/TF risks in the precious stones and precious metals dealers, or the “PSMD”, sector.

{:start="8"}
8. In 2014, the cash transaction reporting regime under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes Act, or “CDSA”, was introduced. This requires PSMD to perform customer due diligence, keep records and file cash transaction reports for cash transactions exceeding S$20,000.

{:start="9"}
9. In 2015, more comprehensive AML/CFT measures were introduced for Pawnbrokers, a subset of the sector.

{:start="10"}
10. Given the inherent risks in the PSMD sector however, there is a need to take additional and further steps. This would also bring our regime fully in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.


**<u>OBJECTIVES</u>**

{:start="11"}
11. The Bill will strengthen existing measures by establishing a comprehensive supervisory and regulatory regime that is risk-focused and which addresses the specific ML/TF risks in the PSMD sector.


<ol start="12">
<li> It will allow us to prevent dealing in precious stones and precious metals from being used to facilitate ML/TF, by:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  Firstly, regulating persons who carry on a business of regulated dealing or business as an intermediary for regulated dealing; and</li>
<li>Secondly, providing for additional measures beyond the current cash transaction reporting regime for the PSMD sector.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>


**<u>DEVELOPMENT OF THE BILL</u>**


<ol start="13">
<li> We have developed the Bill in consultation with key stakeholders through:

<ol style="list-style-type: lowwer-alpha">
<li>Firstly, a survey of the industry; </li>
<li>Secondly, consultations with industry associations such as the Singapore Jewellers Association, Diamond Exchange of Singapore, and the Singapore Bullion Market Association; and </li>
<li>Finally, through a public consultation held between 13 September and 12 October 2018. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="14"}
14. In response to the feedback received, we have streamlined the requirements of the Bill to manage regulatory and compliance costs. We have also benchmarked the requirements against practices in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and also, Belgium.   


**<u>KEY FEATURES</U>**

{:start="15"}
15. Let me also run through the key features of the Bill with the House.

<li>  Firstly, provides for the appointment of a Registrar to supervise the PSMD sector;</li>
