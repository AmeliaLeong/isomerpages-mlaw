**Introduction**

1.In February 2012, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) announced that a package of measures  would be implemented in the second quarter of the year to give Singapore Law Practices (SLPs) greater flexibility to develop and grow their capabilities, and collaborate with Foreign Law Practices (FLPs), to enhance their competitiveness.

2.The legislative changes to give effect to these changes will come into effect on **<u>1 June 2012</u>**. They are summarised below:

**Collaborations between SLPs and FLs/FLPs**

2.1 **SLPs which employ Foreign Lawyers (FLs) in their local practices.** FLs employed within an SLP will now be able to take a greater profit and equity share of up to a maximum of one-third (33 per cent) in the SLP, beyond the 25 per cent permitted under the previous framework.

2.2 **SLPs which tie up with FLPs based overseas.** FLs within an overseas FLP will now be able to take a greater profit and equity share of up to a maximum of one-third (33 per cent) in the SLP, beyond the 25 per cent permitted under the previous framework. An FLP based overseas will now also be able to directly take profit and equity share in the SLP up to the same one-third cap. Lawyers who are partners in the respective practices involved in the tie-up will be able to hold concurrent partnership positions in the practices.
