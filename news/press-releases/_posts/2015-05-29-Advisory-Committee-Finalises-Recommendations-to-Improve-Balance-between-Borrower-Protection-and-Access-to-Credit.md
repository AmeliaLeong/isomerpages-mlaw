1. In June 2014, the Ministry of Law announced the formation of an Advisory Committee to review the moneylending regulatory regime in Singapore. The Committee has since completed this review and today announced 15 recommendations to strengthen Singapore’s moneylending regulatory regime. 

<ol start="2">
<li>The recommendations aim to:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li> protect borrowers, who may have noalternative but to go to moneylenders, by curbing egregious and unfair lending practices; and</li>
<li>allow the industry to remain commercially viable so that borrowers are not pushed to unlicensed moneylenders.</li>
</ol>


</li>
</ol>


{:start="3"}
3. Under the existing regime, there is no cap on interest and late interest rates for borrowers earning more than $30,000 annually. Moneylenders are allowed to charge fees relating to variation of the terms of the loan contract, dishonoured cheques issued, unsuccessful GIRO transactions, and early redemption of the loan or early termination of the contract.  There is also no cap on the total borrowing costs for moneylending loans.

{:start="4"}
4. The Committee’s recommendations focused on two key areas – interest rates and loan caps, and the moneylenders’ business practices.

**Controls on borrowing costs and over-borrowing**

<ol start="5">
<li>On interest rates and loan caps, the Committee recommended restricting moneylenders to the following maximum rates:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>An upfront administrative fee of not more than 10 per cent of the loan principal;</li>
<li>Interest of not more than four per cent per month, on a reducing balance basis;</li>
<li>Late interest of not more than four per cent per month; and</li>
<li>Late fee of not more than $60 per month.</li>
</ol>

</li>

</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. In addition, the total borrowing cost will be capped at 100 percent of the loan principal. This will help prevent debts from spiralling out of control, as the Committee noted several instances of debts growing by many multiples of the principal sum.

{:start="7"}
7. The Committee also recommended that borrowers earning $20,000 or more a year be subject to an aggregate unsecured borrowing cap of six times their monthly salary. Those who earn less than $20,000 a year will continue to be subject to the existing cap of $3,000. A Moneylenders Credit Bureau (MLCB) will be established to provide a central repository of information on borrowers using moneylenders.

{:start="8"}
8. The proposed caps should allow most moneylenders to continue to earn a reasonable return. Moneylenders will be incentivised to review their cost structures and undertake better credit risk assessment. Some level of consolidation is expected as less efficient operators leave the industry.
