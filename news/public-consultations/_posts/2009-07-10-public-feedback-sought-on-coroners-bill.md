Public Feedback Sought on Coroners Bill
---

**Consultation Period:**  
10 Jul 2009 to 7 Aug 2009

1.The Ministry of Law is proposing to enact a Coroners Bill on death reporting, investigation and Coroner's Inquiries. The proposal for a dedicated Bill on coronial matters arose out of the review of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), where the provisions on Coroner's Inquiries are currently found.

2. Broadly, the proposed Bill makes three key changes to the current system:


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Lawyers will be prohibited from receiving conveyancing moneys into their regular client account to which they have free access, preventing the potential for criminal breach of trust;</li>
<li>Breach of this prohibition will subject the lawyer to disciplinary proceedings;</li>
<li>Conveyancing moneys held by a seller's lawyer in his regular client account (for example, the Option deposit of four or nine per cent of the purchase price which a buyer passes to the seller's lawyer upon exercise of Option) will have to be held by entities approved and appointed by the Minister for Law;</li>
<li>The Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) will be the main entity appointed to hold such conveyancing moneys. The Ministry of Law is also in ongoing discussion with potential participating banks to explore the provision of a service to hold the Option Deposit, and</li>
<li>To prevent manipulation of names of payees, the appointed entities will only release the conveyancing moneys that they hold to approved categories of payees, namely sellers, mortgagee banks, buyers, the CPFB, the Housing & Development Board, IRAS and the Management Corporation of the subject property for arrears in management and sinking funds.</li>
</ol>

8 The Ministry of Law invites interested parties to provide their feedback on the proposed measures to safeguard conveyancing moneys. The consultation period is from **11 to 26 August 2009**. The feedback may be sent in electronic or hard copy form to:
