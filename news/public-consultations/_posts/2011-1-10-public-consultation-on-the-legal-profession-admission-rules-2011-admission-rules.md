---

**Consultation Period:**  
10 Jan 2011 to 31 Jan 2011

1. The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill 2011 contains amendments to inter alia, streamline and improve the procedural framework for admission to the Singapore Bar with a view to amalgamating the disparate admission procedures contained both within the Legal Profession Act (LPA) and various rules enacted thereunder, into a single set of rules to make them more user friendly.

2. The Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 (Admission Rules) to be introduced, seek to consolidate the admission criteria and various other requirements formerly found in Part II of the existing LPA, the Legal Profession Rules, the Legal (Oral Examinations) Rules, the Legal Profession (Fees for Ad Hoc Admission) Rules, the Legal Profession (Practice Training Period) Rules and the Legal Profession (Singapore Bar Examinations â€“ Conduct and Discipline) Rules 2010 under a single piece of subsidiary legislation by:

3. Over the years, the moneylending business landscape has changed significantly. Thus, a major review of the Moneylenders Act was carried out to update the laws governing moneylending to ensure that they remain relevant, keeping pace with changes in consumer credit, business financing, the moneylending industry as a whole and the principles underlying the regulation of the financial industry in general.

4. The Ministry of Law and the Registry of Moneylenders have completed this review. A key outcome is the introduction of a Moneylenders Bill 2008 to repeal and replace the current Moneylenders Act.
