Public Consultation on the Proposed Status of Children (Assisted Reproduction Technology) Bill
---

**Consultation Period:**  
20 Nov 2012 to 20 Dec 2012

A. Introduction


1        The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) proposes to introduce a new Status of Children (Assisted Reproduction Technology) Bill, which will deal with the legal parentage and status of children conceived through assisted reproduction technology (ART).1


2        It is timely to enact the Act given the increasing number of babies conceived through ART in Singapore. The popularity of ART has risen with medical advances to treat infertility, as well as a more affluent and aging population. There is also a need for legal clarity in respect of issues concerning the legal status of children conceived and born where the wrong egg, sperm or embryo was used in the fertilisation procedure as a result of a mistake or negligence.
