Public consultation on the Amendments to the Patents (Patent Agents) Rules
---

**Consultation Period:** . 
25 Nov 2013 to 20 Dec 2013

1. The Patents (Patents Amendments) Bill 2012, passed by Parliament in July 2012, contained amendments to liberalise the patent agent registration regime to allow foreign-registered patent agents to register at IPOS and undertake offshore patent agency work, without having to meet Singaporeâ€™s registration requirements. 

2. The liberalisation of the patent agent registration regime is aimed at expanding and deepening patent agency capabilities in Singapore, particularly in relation to international patent agency work.  This is expected to help develop and attract greater demand for Singapore-based patent services, and support our ambition to become a global IP hub in Asia.

3. The scope of offshore patent agency work that foreign-registered patent agents can undertake in Singapore will include:

<li>the patent law of any country other than Singapore; or</li>
<li>an international application for a patent, including PCT applications; and</li>
</ol>
