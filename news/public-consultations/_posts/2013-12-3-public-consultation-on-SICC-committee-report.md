Proposal to introduce a new Moneylenders Bill 2008
---

**Consultation Period:**
3 Dec 2013 to 31 Jan 2014

**Background**

1. Against the backdrop of increasing investment, trade growth, and cross-border transactions and disputes in the region, the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon mooted the idea of creating the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) at the Opening of Legal Year 2013.

2. In May 2013, a 19-member committee, co-chaired by Ms Indranee Rajah SC, Senior Minister of State for Law and Education, and Justice V K Rajah, Judge of Appeal, Supreme Court of Singapore, was formed to study the viability of developing a framework for establishing the SICC. The Committee comprised international and local members to provide a wide range of expertise and views.

3. The SICC Committee submitted its report to the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) on 29 November 2013.

4. The Government welcomes the recommendations made by the SICC Committee. MinLaw and the Supreme Court will carefully consider the recommendations as well as the issues raised within. The SICC Committee’s report can be found at [Annex A](/files/Annex-A-SICC-Committee-Report.pdf). MinLaw has also issued a press release, which may be found [here]()z.
