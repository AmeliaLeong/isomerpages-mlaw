Public Consultation on Proposed Changes to Singapore’s Registered Designs Regime
---

**Consultation Period:**  
12 Oct 2015 to 7 Dec 2015

<b>1. <u>Introduction</u></b>

1.1. The Ministry of Law (“MinLaw”) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”) are seeking feedback on proposed changes to Singapore’s registered designs regime. The public consultation period is from 12 October 2015 to 7 December 2015.  

<b>2. <u>Background</u></b> 

2.1.     Design protection, like other forms of intellectual property (“IP”) rights, aims to encourage innovation by granting rights owners a de facto monopoly over the use of their designs in return for disclosing them and releasing them for public use after a prescribed period.  

 

2.2.     Singapore aspires to be a global city for design creativity and excellence in Asia.  Design is a critical aspect in Singapore’s move towards a knowledge-based economy. In this regard, we have seen an increasing sophistication in the use of designs to differentiate products, create economic value, and also to enrich our lives. The protection of good design is worthwhile from both an economic and social perspective.
