Proposal to lower the Age of Contractual Capacity from 21 years to 18 years, and the Civil Law (Amendment) Bill
---

**Consultation Period:**  
23 Aug 2016 to 7 Nov 2016

**Introduction**

Copyright is a form of intellectual property right which gives creators and producers of creative works the right to control specific uses of their works for a limited period of time.

A good copyright regime balances between providing exclusive rights as an incentive to create and disseminate new creative works, and providing appropriate access to those works for the benefit of other creators and society at large. This balance encourages the creation and dissemination of knowledge and ultimately contributes to the larger drive to foster innovation.

Copyright law has to be regularly updated in order to maintain this delicate balance in a rapidly changing world.  Significant technological and market changes over the last decade due to the digital era have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed.

**Review of the Copyright Act**

MinLaw and IPOS are reviewing the copyright regime with the objectives of ensuring that it has rights which are reasonable, clear and capable of being efficiently transacted.

The following topics reflect MinLaw’s and IPOS’ proposals on possible changes to the Singapore copyright regime. Read the full consultation paper here.
