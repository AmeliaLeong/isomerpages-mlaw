**Consultation Period:**  
21 Oct 2016 to 2 Dec 2016

1. The Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Finance plan to introduce various amendments to the Companies Act in 2017. This public consultation seeks feedback on amendments specifically concerned with reforms to Singapore’s debt restructuring and corporate rescue framework. The Ministry of Finance will be seeking public feedback on other reforms to the Companies Act in due course.


**Background**


2. In 2013, the Insolvency Law Review Committee (“ILRC”) made recommendations to holistically update Singapore’s corporate insolvency and bankruptcy laws. Public consultation was held on the ILRC’s report in Dec 2013, and the Government has welcomed its recommendations.


3. In May 2015, building on the ILRC’s recommendations, the Minister for Law set up the Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring (“Restructuring Committee”) to consider how to enhance Singapore’s effectiveness as a centre for international debt restructuring. After public consultation which lasted from April to May 2016, the Government broadly accepted the Restructuring Committee’s recommendations, which include proposed enhancements to our legal framework for restructuring.


4. In view of the complexity and volume of legislative amendments required to fully implement the relevant recommendations of both the ILRC and the Restructuring Committee, the Ministry of Law is taking a phased approach to implementation. The first phase will comprise legislative amendments which are key to enhancing Singapore’s corporate rescue and restructuring framework. The relevant provisions of the proposed Companies (Amendment) Bill is enclosed at [Annex A]().




**Summary of Bill’s provisions**


5.    A summary of the proposed changes is as follows:  

  a) Schemes of arrangement: A new set of provisions will be introduced to specifically support creditor schemes of arrangements that implement debt restructuring proposals (see Clause 2,  Section 211A),:    
  
  * Enhanced moratoriums against creditor action, aimed at conferring a greater protection to a debtor during a restructuring. The changes include:  
    * allowing the Court to grant a moratorium when the company has made the application to call a meeting of its creditors or intends to make such an application (see Clause 2, Section 211B(1)).
    * an expansion in the scope of the moratorium available to be similar to what is available in judicial management (see Clause 2, Section 211B(4)).
    * allowing for an automatic 30 day moratorium, subject to safeguards for creditor interests (see Clause 2, Section 211B(2), (3) and (8)).
    * moratoriums with in personam worldwide effect, i.e. the court may restrain creditor action overseas, if the creditor is within Singapore’s jurisdiction (see Clause 2, Section 211B(5)(b)).
    * allowing extension of moratorium to related entities to the debtor (see Clause 2, Section 211C).
