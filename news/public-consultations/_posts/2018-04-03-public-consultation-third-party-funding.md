Public Consultation to Seek Feedback on the Third-Party Funding Framework
---

**Consultation Period:**  
3 Apr 2018 to 15 May 2018

**A. Background**

1. The Civil Law (Amendment) Act 2017 (the “Civil Law Act”), which was passed in Parliament on 10 January 2017, puts in place a framework for third-party funding for international commercial arbitration in Singapore. The amendments, together with the Civil Law (Third-Party Funding) Regulations 2017 (the “Civil Law TPF Regs”), came into force on 1 March 2017.

2. Third party funding refers to the funding of proceedings by an unconnected entity to a dispute in return for financial gain, such as a share of the damages awarded or a share of the settlement sum. Prior to the amendments, funding of legal proceedings by unconnected parties was historically characterised as maintenance and champerty and therefore considered unlawful.

**B. Summary of the current legislative framework**

3. The Civil Law Act clarified that the common law torts of maintenance and champerty, which previously restricted the use of third-party funding, were abolished<sup>[1]</sup>. Contracts affected by maintenance and champerty continue to be contrary to public policy or are otherwise illegal, and hence are unenforceable unless they fall under permitted categories of dispute resolution proceedings<sup>[2]</sup>.

4. The categories of dispute resolution proceedings for which third-party funding are permitted are specified in the Civil Law TPF Regs, as follows: 

<ol><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ol>

<b><sup>*</sup>Update</b>: The proposal to equate solicitor-and-client costs to party-and-party costs, fixed according to a scale, is no longer a part of the consultations.
