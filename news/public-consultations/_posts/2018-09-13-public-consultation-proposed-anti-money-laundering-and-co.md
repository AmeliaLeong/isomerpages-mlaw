**Consultation Period:**

13 Sep 2018 to 12 Oct 2018

**I. <u>Introduction</u>**

1. The Ministry of Law announced on 17 July 2018 that it will be introducing a new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory regime for precious stones and metals dealers (PSMD). See [<u>Annex A</u>](/files/Annex-A-17-Jul 2018-AMLCFT-Press-Release.pdf/).


2. The public is invited to provide feedback on the proposed regime. This public consultation will run from 13 September 2018 to 12 October 2018.

**II. <u>Background</u>**

3. Money laundering (ML) enables criminals to commit crimes by obscuring the proceeds of their crimes, while terrorism financing (TF) refers to the use of funds/assets to support terrorist organisations and terrorism. Singapore has a strong regulatory AML/CFT framework for prevention, supervision, enforcement, confiscation of the proceeds of crime, and targeted financial sanctions against terrorism and proliferation financing. Singapore also has a good framework for international coordination on AML/CFT and has in place mechanisms to assess and mitigate the ML and TF risks identified. There is robust supervision of the financial sector, with regular engagements fostering a deep understanding of AML/CFT issues within the industry. Designated non-financial sectors, such as pawnbrokers, are also subject to a comprehensive range of AML/CFT measures.

4. Precious stones and metals are portable, valuable, and easily convertible to cash. This exposes the PSMD sector to inherent ML and TF risks. Currently, all PSMDs need to comply with the requirements under the cash transaction reporting (CTR) regime<sup>[1]</sup> which includes the need to conduct customer due diligence for cash transactions exceeding S$20,000. However, unlike other designated non-financial sectors, the PSMD sector does not have to meet other AML/CFT requirements, such as conducting assessments of the ML/TF risks they face or introducing appropriate internal controls to address these risks.

5. The Ministry of Law proposes to enact a new law to establish an AML/CFT regulatory regime for the PSMD sector to close these gaps. The regime will mitigate ML/TF risks and level up AML/CFT standards and trust in the sector. This is crucial to combating crime and improving security, both domestically and globally.


6. In developing the proposed regulatory regime, MinLaw had conducted an industry survey and informal discussions with industry stakeholders, including industry associations, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. MinLaw has also studied the FATFâ€™s requirements and global best practices for AML/CFT regulation.

**III. <u>Requirements of the Regime</u>**

7. A risk-based approach was adopted in designing the regime with the aim of effectively mitigating ML/TF risks while taking into account the impact on compliance costs. Under the new regime, PSMDs will be required to:
