<li>INTRODUCTION</li>
</ol>
---

1. The Ministry of Law (“**MinLaw**”) is seeking feedback on a draft Intellectual Property (Dispute Resolution) Bill (“**the Bill**”), attached at [Appendix A](/files/Appendix_A-Draft _IPDR_Bill_for_Public_Consultation.pdf/){:target="_blank"} to this public consultation paper.

2. The Bill contains amendments to primary legislation to implement reforms to the intellectual property (“**IP**”) dispute resolution system. Two public consultations on the reforms were previously held, and more information can be found in the respective public consultation papers:

<ol style = list-style-type:"lower-alpha">
  <li>In July 2017, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”) held a public consultation on two proposed patent proceedings, third party observations and post-grant re-examination.<sup>[1]</sup></li>
  <li>In October 2018, MinLaw held a public consultation on reforms to enhance access to our courts for IP disputes (<b>“October public consultation paper”</b>).<sup>[2]</sup></li>
</ol>

3. In addition to the proposals contained in the public consultations mentioned at para 2 above, the Bill also makes the following amendments:

<ol style = list-style-type:"lower-alpha">
  <li>Amendments to clarify the arbitrability of IP disputes in Singapore.</li>
  <li>Other ancillary amendments related to IP dispute resolution.</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. The remainder of this public consultation paper contains explanatory remarks on the draft Bill. Please note that the amendments are not discussed in this paper in the same order in which they appear in the Bill. Rather, the amendments are grouped and discussed thematically.

5. **Please note that the proposed amendments in the Bill are still undergoing the legislative drafting and vetting process, and are thus not finalised and subject to change.**

6. Interested persons are invited to provide comments and feedback. Respondents are requested to indicate your name and the organisation you represent (if applicable), as well as contact details (email address and/or telephone number) to enable us to follow up and seek clarification, if necessary. Please title all comments and feedback “IP (Dispute Resolution) Bill Public Consultation Comments” and send them by 5 April 2019 via post or email to:
