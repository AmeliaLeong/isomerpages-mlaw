<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>

1. I am glad to invite all of you here to Maxwell Chambers. We conceptualised this as the first fully integrated facility in the world, where lawyers can come in and seamlessly work, with on the spot transcription and breakout rooms, structured and conceptualised with the idea of practising lawyers in mind and international arbitrations. You can see it for yourself. We look at it as another example of the way in which we are setting out the legal infrastructure as we grow as a legal centre. I hope you will have the opportunity of looking around yourself and seeing what we have done. 

2. Thank you for inviting me to join in this plenary on “Singapore and the Rule of Law”. 

<ol start="3">
<li>  I will:

<ol>
<li>set out what we consider to be the essential elements of Rule of Law; </li>
<li>how it is applied in Singapore; </li> 
<li>the situations where we have detentions without trial, rather than the normal due process. I will deal with them and explain why have these powers; and </li>
<li>deal with some broader points relating to our Criminal Justice System. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

4. We are then scheduled to have a discussion, chaired by Mr Duffy.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li> Meaning of Rule of Law</li>
</ol>

{:start="5"}
5. There is considerable debate on what is meant exactly by the term “Rule of Law”. There is a further question of the relationship between “Rule of Law” and “Rule By Law”.


<ol start="6">
<li>I will not attempt a comprehensive definition or an academic analysis. Instead, I would suggest, as a practical approach, that the following elements are some key aspects of a society based on Rule of Law:

<ol>
<li>Exercise of State power should be through laws that are publicly known and enacted legitimately. </li>
<li>There should be independent, credible Courts to apply the law and decide on disputes between individuals, as well as between individuals and the State. There must be Separation of Powers. </li>
<li>No person should be above the law. That should apply in equal measure to the Government and officials as much as it does to everyone else. </li> 
<li>There should be credible and effective means for people to challenge the arbitrary exercise of power. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>


<ol start="7">
<li>I will suggest two other elements as part of a broader framework. It is debatable whether they are part of a strict definition of Rule of Law. But most people will accept them as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured:

<ol>
<li>the people must have the sovereign right to elect their Government; and</li>
<li>the laws must not offend that society’s norms of fairness and justice.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Our Approach</li>
</ol>

{:start="8"}
8. Our approach, from the beginning of statehood in 1959 was to recognise the fundamental importance of Rule of Law. Our challenge has been to work out how that ideal can be implemented in the context of the social, economic and security imperatives that we were faced with.

{:start="9"}
9. Let me explain the imperatives – because the laws and the conventions of society can only be understood if you have an idea of that society and how it had evolved.


<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Singapore: A brief background</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"}
10. Singapore started its modern existence as a British colony. In 1959, we were given limited autonomy, statehood. The British were still in charge.

{:start="11"}
11. In 1963, we joined the Federation of Malaysia. A small city in a larger country.

{:start="12"}
12. In the 1950s, Singapore was recovering from the severe disruptions and dislocations of World War II and a brutal Japanese Occupation. The economy was almost entirely trade dependent, based on our Port. There were no other major sectors or drivers of economic growth. Literacy rates were low. Unemployment was high. Housing was, as in many third world cities, poor. Several families literally cramped into small spaces. We had about 2 million people in 580 sq km.

{:start="13"}
13. It was an immigrant society. Many had come with the intention of making money and then returning to their original homelands. Many in my generation are 1st Generation Singaporeans. There was no clear sense of a nation or state. There was no sense of a long shared history or culture or language. The idea that this island, with this mix of population, can be a sovereign state would have been completely ridiculous.

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li> Our approach to social transformation</li>
</ol>

{:start="14"}
14. In 1959, when Singapore achieved self government, this was the situation.

{:start="15"}
15. The challenge was: how do you give people a better life. There was then no idea of independence. That came later.

{:start="16"}
16. For the society to progress, the basic public goods had to be provided – like education, healthcare, housing. Basically, governance.

<ol start="17">
<li> There were four essential conditions for such governance:

<ol>
<li> Rule of Law </li>
<li>Stability </li>
<li>Security – from external threats </li>
<li> A high quality public service </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="18"}
18. I will discuss each aspect, but focus on the first two.

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Rule of Law</li>
</ol>

{:start="19"}
19. We have considered Rule of Law to be fundamental to progress from where we were for two reasons.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li> First Reason</li>
</ol>

{:start="20"}
20. I had described the nature of our society to you: disparate, multi-ethnic, multi religious, poor. A basis had to be established on which people could interact with each other. That basis had to be secular and Rule based. It had to assure equality regardless of race, language or religion.

{:start="21"}
21. We never underestimated the power of chauvinism. Over the years, violence based on ethnicity has been a prevalent feature in this region.

{:start="22"}
22. Singapore was and is based on an ideal: that people of different backgrounds can come together and create a nation, and be assured of equal opportunities, even though one race, the Chinese, formed the vast majority – 75 per cent. That ideal could be achieved only through the Rule of Law. Majority rule could easily have translated into the oppression of minorities. One of the successes that we can be truly proud of is that despite all the electoral advantages of a chauvinistic approach, that was deemed unacceptable, and we worked hard to have a society based on equality and racial harmony.

{:start="23"}
23. So we had a written Constitution, Separation of Powers and structured the society based on law.

{:start="24"}
24. We were fortunate that our first generation of leaders understood the importance of Rule of Law, and at the same time understood how it can be applied as a practical matter in our society.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Second Reason</li>
</ol>

25. The second reason why the Rule of Law was fundamental for us was economic.

26. In 1965, our GDP was US$500 per capita.

27. We had a weak economy. There was a large dependence on trade and the British bases, which I think contributed about 20 per cent of GDP or so. 

28. We decided to move into manufacturing. But capital and technology were needed. That had to come from foreign investment.
