Your Excellencies,  
Mr Eduardo Ramos-Gomez, Managing Partner, Duane Morris & Selvam LLP,  


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman: font-weight:bold; ">
<li> Introduction</li>
</ol>

Thank you for inviting me for this summit. 

1. I hope that our Latin American friends who are visiting Singapore for the first time will find us hospitable. We thank Duane Morris for having this inaugural summit.  

2. It recognises the importance of legal services as a key enabler for cross-border commerce.

<li> Global Economy</li>
</ol>


<ol start="3">
<li>The global economy is uncertain:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We have the European debt crisis and the Euro Area 2012 growth forecast is at negative 0.5 per cent.</li>
<li>The US has slow growth – the US 2012 growth forecast is at 1.8 per cent.</li>
<li> We have geopolitical tensions – unrest in Middle East region – and a few other places.</li>
</ol>

<li>Asia and Latin America – bucking the trend
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li> In that context, the Asia and Latin America stand out as bright spots against an uncertain world economy.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The regions were resilient through the recent crises, and experienced robust economic growth and continue to grow.</li>
<li>In 2012, the growth forecast for key Asian markets is much higher than advanced economies:

<ul>
<li>  China at 8.2 per cent and we consider that to be slow</li>
<li>India at 7.0 per cent,</li>
<li>The ASEAN 5 of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam are expected to grow at a combined rate of  5.2 per cent</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>The Latin America and Caribbean are expected to grow at 3.6 per cent.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li>Stronger trade ties between Asia and Latin America</li>
</ol>

5. Resilience in these two regions is underscored by a substantially increased bilateral trade between our respective regions.

{:start="6"}
6. Asia is driven by an appetite for Latin American commodities.

{:start="7"}
7. Latin America is driven by an appetite for finished Asian goods and trade networks.
