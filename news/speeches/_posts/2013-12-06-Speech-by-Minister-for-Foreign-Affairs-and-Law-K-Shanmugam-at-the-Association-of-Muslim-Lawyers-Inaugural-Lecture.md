Mohd Marican, President for the Association of Muslim Lawyers,
<br>  
Honourable Judges,
<br>  
Judicial Commissioners,
<br>  
District Court Judges,
<br>  
Fellow Lawyers,
<br>  
Friends.


1. Thank you for inviting me here to speak at this inaugural Lecture, and I look forward to an evening of open, robust, frank discussion.


2. Let me give an overview of the legal sector before going on to the main point I want to make tonight. And maybe I will also pick up on one or two of the points that Mr Marican made.


**Legal Sector**

<ol start="3">
<li>The growth in the business and investment landscape in Asia has brought with it opportunities for our legal services sector to expand and thrive. The Singapore legal sector has seen robust growth over the last five years. 

<ul>
<li>The nominal value of the legal services sector has grown by about 25% from just under S$1.5 billion in 2008 to an estimated S$1.85 billion last year.</li>  
<li>We are also exporting more legal services. From 2008 to 2011, the value of legal services exported from Singapore increased by 50%, from S$363 million to S$551 million in 2011.</li>
</ul>
  
</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
The sector’s growth has been catalysed by various measures that have been progressively introduced to bring more international work into Singapore.

<ul>
<li>For instance, QFLP licences have given tremendous opportunities to local lawyers to do cross     border work and develop deep specialisation. The realisation Mr Marican mentioned, it’s a matter of public record, that I have said, that when it was first suggested, I had grave doubts on the efficacy of opening up, particularly QFLPs. But when I became Minister, I had the government policy to implement and  implemented it. With hindsight, on my perspective, I think it was the right move. At that time, if you look at the committee which recommended it, it comprised – all the people who supported it came from all the major firms, Drew & Napier was supportive, so was I believe, Rodyk, so was I think, Rajah and Tann and Wong Partnership. You had the senior partners, the more significant lawyers from these firms represented in the committee which signed off on it. I think the one notable exception was Allen & Gledhill, which didn’t sign off on it. And, I mean, there were competing views as to whether it made sense or didn’t made sense. And one argument would be why is there a need to let QFLPs into Singapore to do local work? How does that increase international work in Singapore? A perfectly valid argument, which is the argument that I thought made sense, but obviously I was overruled on that.</li>

<li>But apart from QFLPs we are also doing extremely well in international arbitration.</li>

<li>Aside from the success of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, our Singapore law firms have also gained global recognition for their growing expertise in international arbitration. Rajah & Tann, Drew & Napier, Allen & Gledhill, Stamford Law, Rodyk and other firms – they are all making the news in the region. </li>
</ul>

{:start="5"}
5. And we continue to consider new ways to grow the legal sector in Singapore.

<ul>
<li>A few days ago, I announced our plans to set up the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). The SICC will be positioned to attract litigation cases that would otherwise not have come into Singapore.</li>

<li>And to cement our position as Asia’s premier legal centre, and I say that advisedly, that we are   Asia’s premier legal centre now, but to cement that position, we will strongly develop our capabilities in international commercial mediation. </li>

<li>We have accepted recommendations proposed by the working group on international commercial mediation. And we will work with stakeholders on implementation. </li>  
</ul>


**Further legal infrastructure initiatives**

{:start="6"}
6. And as we grow the economic space for our lawyers and law firms, we will focus on other aspects of the law which directly impact on our citizens, and many small firms.

<u>The Third Law School</u>

{:start="7"}
7. The 4th Committee highlighted the need to sustain the supply of lawyers specialising in criminal and family law work.  These are fundamental legal services that our community requires. The 4th Committee recommended the setting up a Third Law School. It will be sited at UniSIM. And it will prioritise admissions for mature students. It will concentrate on students gaining the necessary practical skills. And it will have a multi-disciplinary focus, with associated social work aspects as part of its syllabus.

{:start="8"}
8. And I personally supported it because I think it is the prime example of a society with second chances. You can’t get into NUS, SMU, you’ve gone on to do something else – you’ve become a police officer, a teacher, a social worker, you’ve done something else and you now want to become a lawyer –this third law school will look for people like that. So it will focus primarily on mature students, though fresh graduates – some will be looked at as well.

{:start="9"}
9. The Steering Committee will be chaired by Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah, who will be working out the implementation for the Third Law School.

<u>Family Law</u>

{:start="10"}
10. There will be substantial changes in the way Family Law is dealt with in Courts. We really think that we need to make a move on this, and the focus should be on children, the focus should really not been on what happened in the past and long affidavits. We’ll be looking at cutting it down, getting specialists in and easing the pain considerably. A very different, family-focused approach to the practice of family law.

<u>Civil Legal Aid</u>

{:start="11"}
11. Earlier this year, we also extended civil legal aid to more people. That will enable greater access to justice for those who need but cannot afford basic legal services.

{:start="12"}
12. Amendments to the Legal Aid and Advice Act took effect from 1 July 2013 and it now covers about 25% of Singaporean households. And really the principle that I have taken is – you want to cover the 25%, you really don’t want to go into the territory of small law firms because where people can afford the small law firms, they should go there. But people who can’t afford it, the state should help.

{:start="13"}
13. But quite importantly, we have also given greater discretion to the Legal Aid Bureau to grant additional reliefs for applicants in certain types of matrimonial cases. So we will make exceptions there and allow greater ease of access for matrimonial cases.

{:start="14"}
14. These changes have been discussed, maybe they haven’t been put together in a single speech. But really, with regard to Mr Marican’s point as to contingency fees, I am conservative when it comes to legal practice and for too long when I have seen what has happened elsewhere on contingency fees, particularly the US – champerty, contingency fees – I have not been very enthused by it. I can see the access to justice points but I can say that this is something we have considered and are considering very carefully because for every argument that is in favour of it, there are many arguments that also, well, show up the problematic nature of going down that road. But I’m not saying no, but I’m saying we’re giving it every possible thought to see whether it can increase access. And we have to be satisfied that it’s in the best interest. If we are not satisfied, then we can’t implement it.

{:start="15"}
15. Primarily today, the main focus of this speech is going to be the next topic which is criminal legal aid. 

<u>A New Approach to Criminal Legal Aid</u>

<ol start="16">
<li> Legal Aid in Criminal cases:

<ul>
<li>At present, the legal assistance for all capital cases is funded by the State (through ‘LASCO’).</li>

<li>The Government also gives indirect criminal legal aid – it provides annual funding to the Law Society’s Pro Bono Services Office.</li>

<li>And of course lawyers, do a bulk of the heavy lifting, volunteering their services through ‘CLAS’, and various Community Legal</li> Clinics. 
</ul>  

</li>  
</ol>

{:start="17"}
17. Historically, criminal legal aid was provided for in the original Legal Aid Act and Advice Ordinance in 1956. But those provisions were never brought into effect.

{:start="18"}
18. The Government’s position has been that providing criminal legal aid would put the State in the position of using public funds to both prosecute and defend the same accused persons, after significant resources had been allocated to the careful and meticulous investigation, assessment and conduct of prosecutions. And provisions from the Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance relating to criminal legal aid were in fact deleted in 1995.

{:start="19"}
19. Nevertheless from 2007, the Government started funding criminal legal aid indirectly by providing support to the Law Society for operating its pro bono criminal legal aid efforts, which I said earlier. And of course, Community Legal Clinics as well as CLAS have played key roles in assisting accused persons.

{:start="20"}
20. My Ministry has been reviewing this position for quite some time now. We have decided to give direct assistance and support in criminal cases to Defendants – through Criminal Legal Aid. It will require statutory intervention; we’ll put through the legislation.

{:start="21"}
21. Details are now being worked out. Current estimates - there are about 12,000 accused persons annually, of whom at least half, we think, or about 6,000, could benefit from some form of legal representation.

{:start="22"}
22. CLAS sees about 1,000 applications per year – and 200 to 300 applicants qualify for aid. The types of offences for which they may be granted assistance under CLAS are also limited. Our new approach will help address many of these needs.
