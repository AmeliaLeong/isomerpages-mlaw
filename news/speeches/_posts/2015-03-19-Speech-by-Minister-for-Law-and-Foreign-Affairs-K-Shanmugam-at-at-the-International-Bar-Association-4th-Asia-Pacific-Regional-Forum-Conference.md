**Introduction**


1. Good morning

2. As you meet in Singapore, let me share a few thoughts about developments in this region and in Singapore.

3. This may be of some relevance to you in the context of today’s conference theme: “Borderless Asia”.

<ol start="4">
<li>I will speak on 3 aspects:

<ul>
<li>First, observations on the growth, development and opportunities in Asia, in particular ASEAN; </li>
<li>Second, our role as a regional hub against this economic backdrop; and</li>
<li>Third, the steps that we have taken to enhance Singapore’s ability to serve the needs of the growing Asia legal market.</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

**The Asian economic back drop**

{:start="5"}
5. Let me start with the Asian economic back drop.


{:start="6"}
6. As all of you know, Asia is booming.


{:start="7"}
7. Given that Asian countries are at different stages of economic growth; their large populations which are hardworking and bright; and the resources in Asia, this boom is going to go on for a very long time.


{:start="8"}
8. Asia’s GDP grew faster than the rest of the world, by more than 6% in 2013.


{:start="9"}
9. Trade and investment flows have also expanded substantially in this region.


{:start="10"}
10. Asia accounted for more than one-third of global trade and foreign direct investment (“FDI”) inflows in 2013.

{:start="11"}
11. This growth is happening not just in China and India, but also in many other parts of Asia.

{:start="12"}
12. Something that many people don’t realise - ASEAN is one of the largest economic blocs in the world.

{:start="13"}
13. It is the third largest in Asia and the seventh largest in the world.

{:start="14"}
14. By 2050, it is projected to be the fourth largest economy globally.

{:start="15"}
15. In 2013, FDI into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, known as the ASEAN-5, was larger than the FDI inflows into China. Not many people realise that either.

{:start="16"}
16. The total ASEAN trade also posted a six fold increase, from US$430 billion in 1993 to US$2.5 trillion in 2013.

{:start="17"}
17. It will get even better.

{:start="18"}
18. The ASEAN Economic Community (“AEC”) will seek to integrate ASEAN into one single regional market.

{:start="19"}
19. It will help in a freer flow of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and capital.

{:start="20"}
20. ASEAN is also reaching out to its major partners in the region - China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.

{:start="21"}
21. This will be done through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (“RCEP”), another free trade agreement.

{:start="22"}
22. Four ASEAN countries, including Singapore, are members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (“TPP”), which is now being negotiated.

{:start="23"}
23. The TPP will go beyond elimination of tariffs and will cover areas such as intellectual property rights, technical barriers to trade, and competition policy.

{:start="24"}
24. All these partnerships present more opportunities for the ASEAN region to grow as a market.


**Singapore’s growth**

{:start="25"}
25. In that context, Singapore is well positioned to ride on these opportunities.

{:start="26"}
26. We were the fourth largest economy in ASEAN in 2013 despite being the second smallest country in this region.

{:start="27"}
27. To give you another illustration, Singapore’s economy is almost the same size as Malaysia’s, although our geographical size and population is a small fraction of Malaysia’s.  

{:start="28"}
28. Our trade and FDI were the highest in ASEAN in that year.

{:start="29"}
29. As a testament to our open economy, we are the 14th largest trading nation in the world in 2013 - a city of 718 square kilometers with 3.8 million population, which is equivalent to a medium sized US city.

{:start="30"}
30. We not only attract investments – we are also an important investor in our own right.

{:start="31"}
31. Again, something that is not well known, but as an illustration - we were the largest investor in China, India and Indonesia in 2013.

{:start="32"}
32. There has been a large inflow of capital into Singapore and we are well-positioned to become the New York of that vibrant economic region.

{:start="33"}
33. A McKinsey study in 2013 showed that the largest number of billion-dollar companies with global headquarters in South East Asia is to be found here.

{:start="34"}
34. Businesses are found to be here for many reasons.

{:start="35"}
35. First, our free trade agreements (“FTAs”) have attracted a number of businesses to base themselves here, and from here, to link up with the rest of the world.
* We signed our first FTA under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1993.
* Today, our network of FTAs includes 21 bilateral and regional FTAs with 32 trading partners, crisscrossing the entire globe.

{:start="36"}
36. Second, we are a key financial centre.
* There are more than 700 financial institutions here in Singapore.
* We are one of the key wealth management centres in the world. Assets estimated at over USD500 billion are managed out of here.

{:start="37"}
37. Third, because we offer a high quality of life. In international rankings, we were ranked as having:
* The highest quality of living in Asia by Mercer;
* The most efficient healthcare system amongst 51 countries by Bloomberg; 
* The best workforce in the world in terms of workers’ productivity and general overall attitude by the Business Environment Risk Intelligence; and
* The second safest city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Our crime rate in 2013 was the lowest in 30 years.

{:start="38"}
38. Against that back drop, we see ourselves as playing a key role to support the legal needs of businesses.

**Singapore’s role as a choice location for dispute resolution**

{:start="39"}
39. Let me focus on one area – dispute resolution.

{:start="40"}
40. Law essentially follows business.

{:start="41"}
41. As businesses grow in this part of world, we can also expect demand for legal services to grow to support regional commercial activity.

{:start="42"}
42. One key area is of course dispute resolution.

{:start="43"}
43. With increased commercial activity, it is natural that the need for dispute resolution will also rise.

{:start="44"}
44. Parties need a neutral, trusted forum to resolve their disputes efficiently, and there is really only one place in Asia for that.

{:start="45"}
45. Singapore aims to provide that platform by offering a full suite of dispute resolution services to businesses.

{:start="46"}
46. With this in mind, a few years ago, we embarked on a series of initiatives to make ourselves a leading arbitration centre.

{:start="47"}
47. That has been successful.

{:start="48"}
48. We are now the third most preferred seat of arbitration worldwide.

{:start="49"}
49. And the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) is the fourth most preferred arbitral institution worldwide.
 
{:start="50"}
50. Since 2000, the SIAC has handled close to 2,000 cases.
 
{:start="51"} 
51. About 80% of the cases administered by SIAC are international in nature. 

{:start="52"}
52. This is a result of calibrated and deliberate measure to put in place arbitration-friendly policies and regulations.

{:start="53"}
53. We have a completely open regime for international commercial arbitration.

{:start="54"}
54. Parties that arbitrate here can engage lawyers of any nationality and use any governing law.

{:start="55"}
55. Our Courts have been supportive of the arbitral process and have consistently supported the finality of arbitration awards.

{:start="56"}
56. We are a signatory to the New York Convention and our International Arbitration Act is UNCITRAL Model Law compliant.
 
{:start="57"} 
57. Looking beyond arbitration, we are now building capabilities and infrastructure to support international commercial mediation and litigation.

{:start="58"}
58. The Singapore International Mediation Centre (“SIMC”) and the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) were both launched a few months ago.

{:start="59"}
59. The SIMC provides international commercial mediation services.

{:start="60"}
60. It has a panel of high quality international mediators with more than 65 highly experienced international mediators from 14 jurisdictions.

{:start="61"}
61. The SIMC also presents parties with the unique option of the Arb-Med-Arb protocol, which is jointly administered by the SIMC and the SIAC.

{:start="62"}
62. If parties are able to settle their dispute through mediation, their mediated settlement can be recorded as a consent award.

{:start="63"}
63. The consent award is accepted as an arbitral award and enforceable under the New York Convention.

{:start="64"}
64. If parties are unable to settle their dispute through mediation, they can of course continue with arbitration.

{:start="65"}
65. On the other hand, the SICC provides the option of a court-based dispute resolution mechanism for international and commercial disputes.

{:start="66"}
66. The key points of the SICC are:

{:start="67"}
67. First, disputes before the SICC will be heard by a distinguished and diverse panel comprising Singapore Judges and eminent international jurists.
* 11 international judges from USA, Australia, the UK, Hong Kong as well as civil law jurisdictions such as Austria, France and Japan have been appointed.
* They include present and former judges as well as senior academics.
* More appointments will be made.

{:start="68"}
68. Second, parties can choose foreign counsel to represent them in cases with no substantial connection to Singapore; or where the Court grants leave, to make submissions on points of foreign law. 

{:start="69"}
69. Third, SICC procedures follow international best practices for commercial disputes. This allows for flexibility in various aspects such as evidential rules.
 
{:start="70"} 
70. Fourth, SICC provides the ability to deal efficiently with cases governed by foreign law.
* Parties can apply to have any question of foreign law be determined on the basis of submissions instead of the usual mode of proof.
* Measures have also been taken to enhance the enforceability of SICC judgments. 
* The recently amended Supreme Court of Judicature Act provides for parties to automatically waive their rights to challenge the enforcement of an SICC judgment unless they indicate otherwise.

{:start="71"}
71. We will also sign the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements later this month. 


{:start="72"}
72. The Convention has two basic aims. 
* One, to ensure that exclusive choice of court agreements are effective; and
* Two, to ensure that judgments by the chosen courts are recognised and enforced in Contracting States. 

{:start="73"}
73. The Convention will help to enhance the enforceability of SICC judgments vis-à-vis other parties to the Convention when it comes into force.

{:start="74"}
74. We are also looking at expanding the scope of our reciprocal enforcement legislation so that SICC judgments can be more effectively enforced throughout the world.

{:start="75"}
75. The approach we took with SICC encapsulates our entire approach in this field as well as other fields to make ourselves a vibrant centre.

{:start="76"}
76. We thought about the idea two years ago; took us two years to conceptualise and prepare the legislation.

{:start="77"}
77. In September last year, the constitution as well as all other legislatures that were necessary to be amended was amended in a single sitting of parliament in one day.

{:start="78"}
78. The court’s formation was then announced in January.

{:start="79"}
79. The SICC, SIAC and the SIMC’s unique features are targeted at deep, international and cross-border disputes.

{:start="80"}
80. They seek to reduce, or if possible, remove barriers to resolving disputes efficiently across borders.  

**Singapore’s role as a choice location for in-house counsel and home base for international firms**

{:start="81"}
81. Apart from dispute resolution, we also want to make Singapore a conducive place for MNCs to base their regional in-house counsel teams.

{:start="82"}
82. We have been ranked top in Asia in the rule of law, for example by the World Justice Project, and in IP protection, for example by the World Economic Forum.

{:start="83"}
83. As businesses expand in the region, companies now have to grapple with a wide range of legal matters including extraterritorial laws, regulatory and compliance issues.

{:start="84"}
84. To support the work of in-house counsel based in Singapore, we amended our Evidence Act, and provided for them to have legal professional privileges and made it absolutely clear that they are covered.
 
{:start="85"} 
85. Many of our Singapore law practices are also developing strong regional practices with expertise in the laws of the region.
 
{:start="86"} 
86. Our university has set up an institute that focuses on developing expertise on laws in the region as well.

{:start="87"}
87. Our top five law firms are among the largest in Southeast Asia.

{:start="88"}
88. With their knowledge and networks, they can serve as market connectors to the rest of Asia.

{:start="89"}
89. Many international law firms and lawyers have also made Singapore their home base in Asia to service other places in the region.  

{:start="90"}
90. 40 of the top 100 law firms globally by revenue are in Singapore.

{:start="91"}
91. There are now close to 1,200 foreign lawyers based in Singapore.

{:start="92"}
92. The international law firms bring with them a wealth of international networks and expertise.

{:start="93"}
93. This concentration of legal activity in Singapore has resulted in a significant growth in our legal sector in the last few years.

{:start="94"}
94. We have provided flexibility for tie ups between foreign and local firms, in a variety of forms and legal structures.

**Conclusion**

{:start="95"}
95. These are, as most of you know, exciting times to be in Asia.

{:start="96"}
96. Asia may not be truly “borderless” yet, but we are taking steps to reduce trade barriers and support business activities in this region.

{:start="97"}
97. We want our legal services sector to play a pivotal role in this growth trajectory.

{:start="98"}
98. And for lawyers and law firms operating here to be part of that action.

{:start="99"}
99. The Government will strongly support businesses and law firms to tap on to opportunities in the region.  

{:start="100"}
100. It is incumbent on all of us - governments across the region, lawyers and businesses - to truly make Asia borderless.

{:start="101"}
101. On this note, I wish all of you a good conference. Thank you.
