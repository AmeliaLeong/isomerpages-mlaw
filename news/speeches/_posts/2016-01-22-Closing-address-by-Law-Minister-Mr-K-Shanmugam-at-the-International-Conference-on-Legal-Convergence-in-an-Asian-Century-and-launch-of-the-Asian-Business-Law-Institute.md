<li> INTRODUCTION</li>
</ol>


1. The Academy has had a successful conference and has launched the Asian Business Law Institute (ABLI). 


2. The ABLI, when the Chief Justice discussed with me, is an exciting prospect.


3. It has great potential to be a catalyst for change. 


4. It can play an important role in the region’s efforts, to have greater legal convergence.  


5. Legal Convergence in turn, can play an important role in Asia’s economic growth.  


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman;font-weight:bold;">
<li>SUMMARY OF THE HIGHLIGHTS </li>
</ol>


<ol start="6">
<li>Today, I would like to take the opportunity to share my thoughts on four issues in this context:-
<ul>
<li>First, briefly, the Asian economic growth story; </li>
<li> Second, how legal convergence can help in economic integration; </li>
<li>Third, how the ABLI can help in this process; and </li>
<li>Fourth, the role Singapore can play. </li>

9. In 2014, the region accounted for nearly two-thirds of the global growth . 

{:start="10"}
10. Cross-border flows of trade and investment in Asia are growing.  

{:start="11"}
11. Regional pacts such as the TPP, and the RCEP, will further increase trade flows. 

{:start="12"}
12. The TPP will create a trading region with a population of 800 million, and a GDP of US$30 trillion .

{:start="13"}
13. The RCEP will be a trade agreement between 16 countries, with a population of three billion, and a GDP of more than US$17 trillion.

{:start="14"}
14. That is a third of the world’s current annual GDP . 

{:start="15"}
15. We can say much more but I think most people accept the growth story.

{:start="16"}
16. So we move to the second point:
