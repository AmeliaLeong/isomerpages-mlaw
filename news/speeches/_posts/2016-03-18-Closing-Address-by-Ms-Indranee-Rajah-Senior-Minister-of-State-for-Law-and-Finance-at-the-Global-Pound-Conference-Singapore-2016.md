Honourable judges,


Fellow lawyers,


Dispute resolution practitioners,

1. Thank you very much for inviting me to do the closing address.

 

2. You were having such a lively discussion just now, I was really very loath to put an end to it and to come up; I felt that you were unduly constrained to come to an untimely end on my account. But it was a wonderful discussion and I’m glad to see that there has been such an excellent exchange of ideas.

 

3. I think that the topics discussed over these two days involved the traditional questions, which are still important, but you’ve obviously ventured into new and refreshing topics of discussion – online dispute resolution and the role of neurobiology and psychology in dispute resolution, all groundbreaking areas. Obviously, having looked at the online mechanisms that you were using, that’s generated some interesting, and perhaps even surprising, data.


4. And the use of the GPC Series platform is just an example of how technology can facilitate work. I am sure that this will kickstart a data collection process that will, when it’s completed, have an impact on the future of dispute resolution in the world.

 

5. Singapore is proud to play a role in this.

 

6. I would very much like to acknowledge the efforts of the organisers, including the International Mediation Institute, the Singapore Mediation Centre, the State Courts, and all the partners who have played a part in this successful event.

**Rise in Disputes**

{:start="7"}
7. There is no shortage of disputes in the world today. In a 2014 survey of 150 senior attorneys and executives from 18 industries, half the respondents expected the number of international disputes to rise over the next two years1. Another survey saw 32 per cent of corporate counsel and compliance officers from US and European companies with annual revenues of $250 million or more report an increase in legal disputes2.

8. And this is not just limited to large, high-value commercial disputes. As the world’s urban population grows, the potential for conflict arising out of social and economic interaction will inevitably grow as well. Employment issues, marriage and family issues – all of these are susceptible to disputes.

9. Disputes all have unique circumstances and considerations but most of the time, the parties want the same thing, which is to end the dispute quickly and cost-efficiently and to be able to move on.

 
{:start="10"}
10. A dispute can impose great strains on productivity, resources and well-being. It can bring a company down or tear apart a family. Take arbitration cases handled by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) at one end of the spectrum, for example. These are typically large, complex, cross-border cases. The Global Arbitration Review found that the average time taken for such cases is more than three years. The longest of these took more than 10 years3!

{:start="11"}
11. And these are the cases handled efficiently, to the best of the abilities of a top institution. So you can imagine if the dispute, whether it be the case itself or the procedure of hearings, were handled poorly.

{:start="12"}
12. Hence, the advantages of being able to resolve a dispute quickly and effectively go without saying.

**Dispute Resolution – A Singaporean Approach**

{:start="13"}
13. I thought it might be helpful, since you are here, to share a Singaporean approach.

 
{:start="14"}
14. There are some fundamentals which we believe in here in Singapore, when it comes to dispute resolution.

<ol style="15">
<li> First, we firmly believe that we need a system, a legal framework, that is trusted by parties to a dispute.


<ol start="lower-alpha">

<li>Trust, in the sense that the system will run the due process – that it’s not corrupt, that it’s efficient, and that it respects the rule of law. These values and principles are non-negotiable and we are serious about upholding them. </li>

 
<li>Trust also comes from neutrality. You can be from Singapore, or Asia, or anywhere across the world, but in Singapore, you will play by the same set rules, which are fixed and transparent for everyone. </li>

<li>Related to this is also our inheritance of the best practices of common law and, from time to time, we also do look at civil law practices. Given the inevitable evolution of jurisprudence and our own national approach towards creating an environment friendly to businesses, Singapore and Singapore law has adapted itself to the context of Asia and developing economies. </li>


</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="16"}
16. The second thing is that a good framework or system also needs good execution or implementation.

<ol start="17">
<li> Our judiciary plays a critical, pivotal role in that.


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Our judges are known for efficiency and competence, and their international outlook – a characteristic which is hardcoded into our DNA. </li>
<li>Our judiciary also understands the value of alternative dispute resolution. They adopt an approach of maximum support and minimal intervention in international arbitration proceedings. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
