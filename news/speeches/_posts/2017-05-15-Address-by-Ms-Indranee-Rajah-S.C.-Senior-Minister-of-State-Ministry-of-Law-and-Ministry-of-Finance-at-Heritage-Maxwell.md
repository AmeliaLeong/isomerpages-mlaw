Commander, Traffic Police, Senior Assistant Commissioner Sam Tee,
<br>
Former Commanders Mr Chua Chin Kiat and Mr Rajoo Gopal,
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen,

**Introduction**

1. I am delighted to join all of you this afternoon.

 

2. There are about 50 of you present today – active and retired Traffic Police personnel who used to work at 28 Maxwell Road. These include two former Commanders: Mr Chua Chin Kiat, who was Commander in the late 1980s, and Mr Rajoo in the late 90s and early 2000s. So I am glad today’s event has provided an occasion to bring together so many past Commanders and officers.

 

3. The strong turnout today reflects the depth of feeling that you have for 28 Maxwell Road, where you had served, and which was for many of you almost a second home, for many years.   

**Setting the Context**

{:start="4"}
4. In case you are wondering why the Ministry of Law has organised this event, allow me to provide some context.

 

{:start="5"}
5. In 2010, the Ministry of Law set up Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex. This is where businesses get their commercial disputes heard by arbitrators or mediators. It also houses the offices of some case administrators, arbitrators, mediators and lawyers who work on these cases.   

 

{:start="6"}
6. Over the last six years, Maxwell Chambers has seen a significant growth in demand for its services from the region. Those who already have an office at Maxwell Chambers want more space to expand. There is a waiting list of others who want to take up space at Maxwell Chambers.  

 

{:start="7"}
7. The Ministry of Law is therefore refurbishing 28 Maxwell Road for the expansion of Maxwell Chambers. This will allow us to meet growing regional demand for dispute resolution services, attract more international institutions, arbitration chambers and law firms to Singapore, and strengthen Singapore’s position as the dispute resolution hub in Asia.

**Heritage@Maxwell**

8. In a nutshell – the lawyers are taking over 28 Maxwell Road! But don’t be alarmed. We will take great care to ensure that the place does not lose its soul and its unique character.

<ol start="9">
<li> Heritage restoration will be a very important part of the refurbishment works. For example:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>In the past ten years or so, after the Traffic Police had vacated the building, several ad hoc awnings and roofs have been added to the building by its then new occupants. All these awnings and roofs will be removed to restore the courtyards to their original open-to-sky design.</li>
