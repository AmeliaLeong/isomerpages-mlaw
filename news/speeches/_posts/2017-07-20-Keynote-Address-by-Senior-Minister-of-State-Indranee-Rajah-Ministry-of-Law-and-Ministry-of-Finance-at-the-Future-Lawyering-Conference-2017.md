Mr Gregory Vijayendran, President, Law Society of Singapore,
 
Friends from the Malaysian Bar Council

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight: bold;">
<li>THE RISE OF THE MACHINES<sup>[1]</sup></li>
</ol>

1. Let me first thank the Law Society for giving me the opportunity to sketch out our thoughts on the future of lawyering. Let me start with my first section which is the Rise of the Machines. I am going to give you a quote, I am not sure how many in the room will recognize the quote - I suspect those born after 1984 may not. But the baby boomers and the Gen X people might.

*"The machines rose from the ashes...Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. <sup>[2]</sup>"*

{:start="2"}
2. Well, for those of you who are Terminator aficionados, would recognize this from the opening scene of "Terminator" (1984). That opening scene harks of a future where the machines have taken over the world and the humans are fighting a battle for survival.
 
{:start="3"} 
3. We haven't quite reached that stage yet although for lawyers I think there is a feeling of being besieged because everywhere you turn, people are talking about the advent of technology. Well, we certainly are on the cusp of a technology explosion. Technology and innovation have already made great changes to the way we live and work. It's not stopping and the pace of technology-driven change is accelerating.
 
{:start="4"} 
4. It will impact all areas of work and lawyering is no exception. It is those lawyers who are able to innovate and adapt and adopt technology who will win the future.  But, just as in the quote, the future will be won not by what you do in the future - because by then it is too late - but by what you do today. 
 
{:start="5"} 
5. The penetration of technology into the practice of law is not something on the distant horizon. It is here and it is now.

*Corporate clients have begun to develop their own legal technology tools*

{:start="6"} 
6. JPMorgan has developed a programme called COIN, short for Contract Intelligence. It interprets commercial loan agreements that used to consume 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers.  Now COIN reviews documents in a matter of seconds and is less prone to error.


*Individuals are starting to obtain legal services from online platforms, bypassing lawyers*

{:start="7"}
7. Amazon and Alibaba have integrated online resolution platforms where algorithms are used to settle claims and compensate consumers without need for lawyers.
 
{:start="8"} 
8. People are starting to use Chatbots for simple legal services. DoNotPay, a Chatbot service in the UK and US helps people to appeal against parking tickets. It asks the user questions on possible exculpatory factors e.g. visibility of No Parking signs and if the robot decides the case merits an appeal, it will generate an appeal letter that the individual can submit to the court. The DoNotPay chatbot lawyer has won 160,000 of the 250,000 appeals it has taken on so far.


*Law firms have started to develop technology solutions for legal work*

{:start="9"}
9. Linklaters has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) application called Verifi which can sift through 14 UK and European regulatory registers to check client names for banks. It processes thousands of names overnight, whereas a junior lawyer would have taken an average of 12 minutes to search each name.
 
{:start="10"} 
10. Then there is ROSS, "the world's first artificially intelligent attorney" built on IBM's cognitive computer Watson which is already being used by US law firms. ROSS learns as it goes along. It is by no means to be a full substitute for a lawyer but it is making inroads with each passing day.


*Other legal technology tools*

{:start="11"}
11. In other countries software is being developed that analyses a lawyer's win-loss record. The time will come when this will become a common tool for clients to check before deciding whether or not to engage a lawyer.
 
{:start="12"} 
12. Other software is being developed which analyses judgments and seeks to predict outcomes before particular courts or judges. This too will become a commonplace tool for both lawyers and clients in deciding whether or not to proceed with a case. It may not replace the lawyerâ€™s judgment, but the lawyer will certainly use this type of software to make a first rough-cut assessment and then the lawyer will do the more in-depth thinking after that.


<ol start="13">
<li>Don't get me wrong. In citing these examples I am not in any way suggesting that AI or technology will replace lawyers.  However what I am saying is that:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>technology will replace many of the tasks that lawyers do today. Mundane, repetitive or labour intensive tasks will increasingly be done by computers, as will be research and certain types of analyse, freeing up lawyers for the higher order of work, more of the value add, the strategic thinking, the things which the machines cannot do. So lawyers have to climb up the value chain, leveraging on technology;</li>
 
<li>technology will change the way lawyers work;</li>
 
<li>and most importantly it will change clients' expectations of the services that lawyers should provide and what the client is willing to pay for.</li>


</ol>


</li>
</ol>

{:start="14"}
14. The future of lawyering therefore is legal practice augmented by technology. The best strategy for lawyers therefore is to embrace technology and not shun it.


<ol start="15">
<li>I am pleased to note that some in the legal fraternity have embarked on this journey:

<ol>

<li>MG/Chambers, a Singapore law firm, has developed its own interactive platform, Vanilla Law, which enables clients to prepare a first draft of a contract which can then be reviewed and fine-tuned by the law firm. This saves costs and time for both the client and the law firm and ups productivity on both sides.</li>
 
<li>Earlier this month, Singapore lawyer Jonathan Wong launched LawGuide Singapore, a free online portal which provides information on different areas of the law. LawGuide also has an AI powered chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform which helps the public understand general legal terms and processes. </li>

</ol>


</li>
</ol>

{:start="16"}
16. Different law firms and lawyers are at different stages of this journey but we want to bring everyone on board.


<ol start="17">
<li>To encourage baseline technology adoption and innovation, MinLaw, LawSoc and SPRING launched TechStart for Law earlier this year. Under this scheme law firms can apply for funding for:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>an office management system;</li>
 
<li>an online marketing platform; and</li>
 
<li>an online workspace which combines an intelligent search engine with a knowledge management system. </li>  


</ol>


</li>
</ol>

<ol start="18">
<li> Let me round off this part on technology by referring to the Future Law Innovation Programme or FLIP announced by CJ Sundaresh Menon last week. FLIP is a platform for law firms to collaborate with technology players to innovate and develop products and services. It has three main components:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>first, a co-working space for shared services and facilities;</li>
 
<li>Second, a virtual community platform which is a virtual extension of the physical FLIP community environment;</li>
 
<li>Third, a legal sector-specific accelerator to groom promising legal tech start-ups and incubate new business models or services conceived by law firms.</li>

</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="19"}
19. If you have feedback on how our rules and regulations can better support technology innovation, do let us know. MinLaw will be happy to work with you on this.
