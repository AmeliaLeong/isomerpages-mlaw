Mr Davinder Singh, S.C.  
Chairman of SIAC  

Ms Lim Seok Hui  
CEO of SIAC  


Distinguished Judges, distinguished ladies and gentlemen

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li> Introduction</li>
</ol>


1. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of SIAC’s flagship Congress. It is a timely forum.

 

2. SIAC continues to break caseload records, with a historical high of 452 last year.

<ol start="3">
<li>Just one week ago, the 2018 International Arbitration Survey results were released. Singapore and SIAC have moved up the ranks again:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>SIAC is now the 3<sup>rd</sup> most preferred arbitral institution in the world; and</li>
<li>Singapore is now 3<sup>rd</up> most preferred seat of arbitration globally.<sup>[1]</sup></li> 
<li>This also means that SIAC and Singapore are now the most preferred institution and seat in Asia.</li>

</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. This is excellent news. Obviously we are very pleased.  Congratulations, SIAC!

<ol start="5">
<li>Since you have been discussing the future of international arbitration, let me to consider two questions.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What role can SIAC and Singapore play in the economy of the future? And</li>
<li>Will arbitration remain the most preferred mode of resolving disputes?</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight: bold;">
<li>The Future of Growth is in Asia </li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>  You would have heard this morning that Asia is driving global growth.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Asia’s rise has been steady and rapid, in spite of uncertainties and downsides in the global trading                              environment.</li>

<li>Asia is expected to grow at over 6.0% this year, more than double the expected growths of other regions in                the world.<sup>[2]</sup></li> 
</ol>


</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
<li>As Asia expands, we will see:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Local companies going global;</li>
<li>International companies coming to meet the needs of growing markets in Asia; </li>   
<li>Growing cross-border commercial activity, which will lead to potential cross-border disputes, and an                            increase in demand for dispute resolution services.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>


<ol start="8" >
<li>The ‘Asia effect’ is already evident in arbitration.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The <i>Global Arbitration Review</i> estimated that between 2012 and 2016, there was a 37% increase in cases                administered by 11 arbitral institutions worldwide.</li>
<li> But caseloads of institutions outside Asia grew by 13%, whereas caseloads of institutions in Asia grew by                  more than 75%!</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="9"}
9. This effect will be multiplied by ambitious plans such as Belt and Road Initiative, which will greatly enhance economic cooperation and interdependence within Asia, and between Asia and the rest of the world.


<ol start="10">
<li>All this augurs well for Singapore.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>As an international commercial hub strategically situated in Asia, we have long been connecting Asia with                  the rest of the world, and connecting the rest of the world with Asia.</li>
<li>Let me touch on how we can play a role in unlocking Asia’s potential, and capture opportunities in this part                of the world.</li>
<li>I will speak about two areas: infrastructure and dispute resolution. </li>


</ol>

</li>
</ol>




<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-roman;font-weight: bold">
<li>  Meeting Asia’s Infrastructure Needs</li>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
<li>  Asia is hungry for infrastructure.


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Its economies are growing, urbanising, and its people are becoming wealthier.  </li>
<li>The UN projects that by 2030, 24 of the world’s 41 megacities will be in Asia.<sup>[3]</sup></li> 
<li>These cities, and the rest of Asia, will need infrastructure and urban solutions – over USD 1.7 trillion of it                    per year, from 2016 to 2030.<sup>[4]</sup></li>  
<li> But the region’s infrastructure needs remain unmet.</li>

</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="12">
<li>Singapore is in a  unique position to bridge this infrastructure gap.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We are developing ourselves as an infrastructure hub for Asia, to connect supply and demand, where                         infrastructure-related expertise, financing, and support can come together.</li>
 <li>   We have built up our own expertise in infrastructure, arising from our own experience in urbanisation. This                   technical knowledge can be put to good use to serve the region’s needs.</li>
 <li> As an international financial centre, we are a one-stop shop for all the infrastructure financing and project                    structuring needs for the region.
      
 <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
 <li>  The World Bank’s first Infrastructure and Urban Development Hub is situated in Singapore,
 co-locating the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee                              Agency (MIGA). They provide a critical source of project structuring knowledge and financing.</li>
<li>Through the Hub, regional governments can access the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF), which                              facilitates the preparation and structuring of complex infrastructure public-private partnerships.                                    Singapore is a founding funding partner of GIF.<sup>[5]</sup> </li>
          
<li>  Our strong position in world capital markets makes us an ideal place to raise financing and mobilise                            investments.</li>
<li> Our banks have a deep understanding of Asia’s infrastructure investment needs, and a track record of                        financing projects. </li>
          
</ol>
      
      </li>
      
      <li>
        And of course, we also have strong professional services to support infrastructure work.
        
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>Our largest accounting firms – PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG – provide project advisory                              services to the region, including in financial optimisation, model development and stress testing.</li>
          <li>
              As an international legal services hub, we are also able to provide strong advice on infrastructure                               work.
