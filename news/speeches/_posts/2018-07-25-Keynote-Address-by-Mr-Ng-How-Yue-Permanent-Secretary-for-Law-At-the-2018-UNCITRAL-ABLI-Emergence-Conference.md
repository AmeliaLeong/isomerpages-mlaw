<li><u>INTRODUCTION</u></li>
</ol>


1. Good morning.

 

2. I thank the organisers for extending this invitation to speak. It is an honour to be here today with distinguished legal experts, scholars and practitioners from the Asian region, and other parts of the world. 

 

3. I am mindful that I am a non-lawyer – an engineer, actually – speaking about legal convergence before an audience of mostly lawyers. For the past few years, I’ve had to work closely with lawyers at the Ministry of Law. My personal experience is that an engineer and a lawyer can have very meaningful conversations on legal matters, because the law is set out logically and systematically, and engineers like logic and systems. Yet, there is often a “language barrier” between us, which we overcome through dialogue and by finding common ground to advance our mutual understanding. 

 

4. Interestingly, this “language barrier” can exist even among lawyers. There are in fact different “legal languages.” Civil lawyers have a certain code, and common law lawyers another. Among countries with the same legal tradition, there is also diversity.

 

5. My colleagues in the Ministry of Law say this “language barrier” can be a real challenge when lawyers negotiate the details of legal convergence. This is particularly so in Asia, where different legal systems exist. While I have no expertise in the technical aspects of legal convergence, I believe the approach taken by ABLI and UNCITRAL is the right one – advance dialogue and understanding, discuss the issues logically and systametically, seek common ground along the pathway towards convergence.

<ol start="6">
<li> Today, I will speak on legal convergence from a policy-makers’ perspective. As policy-makers in Singapore, we understand the value of business legal convergence. I will focus on two main issues:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, Singapore’s experience with legal convergence.</li>
<li>Second, our thoughts on how to advance legal convergence in Asia.</li>
</ol>


</li>
</ol>


7. Before I turn to these issues, it would be useful to recall the desired outcomes of business legal convergence.

<ol start="9">
<li>In our region, trade and investments are growing at a rapid rate.</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Asian economies are leading global economic growth.</li>
<li>By 2030-
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Asia is expected to account for 40% of the world&rsquo;s GDP; and</li>
<li>ASEAN is expected to be the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="17">
<li>On contracts: Businesses may face uncertainty as to how the law will determine what contractual rights and obligations they have. Singapore has used legal convergence to give businesses greater clarity about what rules govern their cross-border contracts, both offline and online.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>In 1995, Singapore became a party to the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods, also known as the CISG.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The CISG has been successful globally, with 89 States Parties, including China, Japan, and the United States.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In 1998, Singapore was one of the first countries to enact legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce.</li>
<li>In 2006, we were one of the first countries to sign the UN Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, a Convention that Singapore played a part in developing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="18">
<li>On dispute resolution: Businesses need the assurance that their dispute resolution outcomes will be enforceable overseas. However, because of legal diversity, they face uncertainty as to when a country will enforce a foreign judgment or arbitration award; even more so for mediated settlements. Singapore is using legal convergence to give businesses greater assurance, across the suite of dispute resolution options.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>For arbitration &ndash; Singapore is, like many countries, party to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>I would pause here to acknowledge that without legal convergence through the New York Convention, international commercial arbitration would not be the reliable and popular mode of international dispute resolution it is today.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For litigation &ndash; Singapore was the first country to enact a dedicated law to implement the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. We are also actively involved in developing the proposed Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments.</li>
<li>For mediation &ndash; Singapore played a leading role in developing the UNCITRAL Convention and amended Model Law on the enforcement of mediated settlement agreements. We look forward to hosting the signing ceremony for this Convention in 2019. I hope that the Singapore Convention on Mediation will be a useful addition to the dispute resolution landscape.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="20">
<li>These are some of the ways in which Singapore has used legal convergence to provide solutions to business challenges. The value of legal convergence, when implemented effectively, is reflected by Singapore&rsquo;s record.</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Singapore has become a base for international companies to access the region&rsquo;s economic opportunities.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>An estimated 37,400 international companies have their headquarters in Singapore</li>
<li>This includes around 7,000 MNCs.</li>
<li>More than half of these international companies run their Asia Pacific operations from Singapore</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="21">
<li>Apart from facilitating economic benefits, legal convergence has also helped Singapore&rsquo;s legal professionals grow their knowledge capital.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>At minimum, incorporating international legal convergence instruments in our domestic laws has given Singapore lawyers the opportunity to acquire expertise in these international legal frameworks. This puts them in good stead to support transnational business.</li>
<li>There is also a first mover advantage that comes from being among the first to adopt legal convergence initiatives. It has allowed Singapore&rsquo;s legal professionals to develop know-how and thought leadership to operationalise legal convergence.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>For example, this year, the Singapore Courts issued its first judgments on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, in cases argued by Singapore lawyers. The decision on the Choice of Court Convention may be the first made in any country.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="28">
<li>The Ministry of Law is also supporting the work of ABLI, which the Chief Justice spoke about just now. I have a few reflections on ABLI&rsquo;s work.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>One is that its approach to legal convergence reflects the three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo;.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>On relevance - It decides on the projects it will undertake based on consultations with stakeholders from the business and legal communities. This ensures that its output is relevant to real needs.</li>
<li>On representation - its output relies on contributions by experts who are local to the countries they are writing about.</li>
<li>Finally, on respect - ABLI is neutral and does not pre-judge solutions. Its working methods ensure that any recommendations for how to operationalise legal convergence are based on a respect for each country&rsquo;s context and perspectives.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ABLI&rsquo;s Foreign Judgments Project is of particular interest, as the Ministry of Law oversees Singapore&rsquo;s foreign judgments policy.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The high quality of analysis of the compendium of country reports published in December last year gave us valuable insight into our region&rsquo;s legal landscape.</li>
<li>We look forward to the Statement of Principles that will be produced in the second phase of this Project. It will be an unprecedented common reference point for policy-makers around the region to understand the legal gaps that we may need to fill, and how we could do so. The work involved is complex, and could be successful only with the help of some of our region&rsquo;s leading legal experts.</li>
