Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen  

1. A very good morning to all.  Thank you for organising a fantastic conference this morning. I am sure given the wonderful turnout; a lot will be exchanged.

 

2. The litigation conference has become a constant fixture on the Law Society’s calendar for many years now – I am told this is the 7th such instalment, and I think it comes at a time when we are looking at some significant changes that are ahead of us. Maybe not in the wintery fashion that has been sketched out but they are ground-breaking, they are also progressive and in a minute I will go through some of these changes and explain the thinking behind some of the provisions.

 

3. The potential impact of the proposals on the practice of civil litigation in Singapore is not insignificant. The line-up of several plenary sessions on so many of these key proposals over the next two days, bears testament to that and really shows us the keen interest which lawyers have in these proposals, and obviously what it means to their practice as civil litigation lawyers.  I will address a few of these proposals later.

 

4. Let me start with addressing one aspect which is the impact on the practice of younger lawyers, many whom are present here today (even if I suspect that many of you are here today to fulfil your CPD requirements).

 

5. Of particular interest to you will be the session tomorrow after lunch where you will talk about the future of the Bar, and the challenges faced by the young lawyers.

 

6. This session tomorrow is really reflective of a larger ongoing conversation which started for a while now and which we will continue to talk about – what it means to be a young lawyer at the Bar today, what are the challenges ahead of us and where we see the Bar in five, ten or fifteen years. This is a key area of concern for the Ministry of Law – we want to see the local Bar grow, compete and succeed. There is no doubt about that. We do not want a Bar that is overtaken by the larger firms while others grow smaller and smaller and soon disappear.

 

7. We want personalities at the bar to shine through. We want firms to take on complex cases and to be leading lights in the practice of law in ASEAN, in Asia and eventually in the region. To do that, it must mean that all lawyers, but perhaps especially the younger ones, must find meaning in practice, and must have an opportunity to develop their skills and find their own place at the Bar.

 

8. To this end, my colleagues in Government, Minister Shanmugam, Minister Indranee and I have in the past year or so, met up with several groups of lawyers in practice. We did this to gather views and understand your concerns about various matters relating to the legal industry, including of course the Civil Justice Reforms.

 

9. During the sessions, the lawyers, particularly the younger ones, have been very vocal about your concerns. We appreciate very much your candour -  it is only with forthright and open exchanges that we can work through what changes are necessary. Some may be necessary as a necessary evil while others may be introduced as a result of feedback from the lawyers. 

 

10. Today, I would like to address some of the issues that have been raised. I will begin by sketching out some of the challenges that relates to the legal profession, including the young lawyers but not just for them. I will also lay out what the Ministry of Law is doing to help make the practice of law a viable and fulfilling career for each of you, and what part each of you can play in this. I will start with the legal profession.

**The CHALLENGES TO OUR PROFESSION** 

{:start="11"}
11. Legal services, that we all perform – is a service.  Legal services are a service to other parts of economy – to banking, finance, and to enterprises – in order to grow our economy. Demand for legal services will grow when the economy prospers.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>The economic uncertainty</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="12"}
12. At the end of 2017, we had the 4<sup>th</sup> highest GDP per capita in the world. To put that into context, we have the 2<sup>nd</sup> smallest population in the ASEAN, but the 4<sup>th</sup> largest economy in terms of absolute numbers. So we have done reasonably well, certainly in comparison to the size we have.

 
{:start="13"}
13. We have reached a point of inflexion however. We have seen growth that has stabilised over the past couple of years at about 2%. This is in contradistinction to the 4 to 6% or even higher growth that some of our neighbours, with their vast resources, enjoy.

<ol start="14">
<li>  On top of that:

<ol>
<li>Our population is not growing; and </li>
<li> We have an aging workforce and just to give you an indication with numbers – today we have about 420,000 Singaporeans who are aged 65 and above. In about 12 years’ time in 2030, that number will double to about 900,000. So what it means is that we have the increased burden of ageing population such as healthcare costs but also more importantly, we have a shrinking workforce that is economically active. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="15"}
15. In addition to this, our traditional strengths – status as an aviation hub and maritime hub – have come under threat from regional competitors.

 
{:start="16"}
16. All of this adds to the uncertain economic climate.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>The challenges to the legal sector</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="17"}
17. Specific to the legal sector, there are several challenges facing our profession.

 
{:start="18"}
18. First, technology. Integration of technology into various aspects of lawyering is definitely upon us and is an issue that has been foreshadowed for several years now. 


<ol start="19">
<li> A study conducted by the International Bar Association several years back suggested that AI may eventually replace a third of graduate-level jobs worldwide:

<ol start="20">
<li>Technology solutions have been developed to aid lawyers with high volume routine work. For instance, Verifi, an AI application developed by Linklaters, can sift through regulatory registers in Europe to check client names for banks at a much faster rate than human lawyers. This is obvious given the routine, rote work involved and also the volume. This frees up the time of lawyers to focus on higher value work. </li>
<li>Legaltech is also being developed to automate certain legal tasks traditionally done by junior lawyers. </li>
<li>AI platforms have also been developed that can take on board precedents, facts of the case, look at the outcome of previous decisions by a particular judge and predict how this judge might rule in respect of specific arguments – a skill we now employ with a lot of guesswork today as counsel. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="21">
<li>   Next, globalisation.  With the rise of globalisation:

<ol start="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Legal services can now be outsourced to lower cost jurisdictions for a fraction of the amount it would cost to instruct Singapore lawyers; </li>
<li>There is growing competition for legal work; and </li>
<li>Increasingly savvy clients who will demand more choice, more transparency, and you will face more competition and price pressures as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>Challenges specific to the younger lawyers</u></li>
</ol>

<ol start="22">
<li>There are other concerns which may also weigh also on the minds of the younger lawyers and we have heard some of the feedback which includes:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Concerns about whether you can get good training, and how you are expected to be prepared for the challenges of legal practice. I have seen the report of the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers, and how the proposals are to be implemented and structured so that we can expect lawyers that come out of training will be relatively prepared for the challenges of practice; </li>
<li>We are also concerned with the high attrition rate of lawyers especially at the middle levels either from burnout or just because there are better options out there; and </li>
<li> Specifically, in respect of the civil justice proposals, the possibility of a reduction in opportunities for advocacy for the young lawyers. We as the more senior lawyers all cut our teeth on some small application which, of course when we were young, meant the world – that was your one application, your one day in court. How do we ensure that the proposals that we have don’t take away those opportunities? </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="23"}
23. These concerns are real. The Ministry of Law is looking at several options and what we can do for the individual lawyers, what we can do for the landscape to increase and enhance opportunities

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><u>MinLaw’s Initiatives</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="24"}
24. Let me start with a few, beginning with technology. Many of you would have heard of Tech Start for Law, which was rolled out for the purpose of helping law firms adopt technology solutions to improve productivity.  $2.8million was committed to this initiative. 115 firms, mostly small and medium sized firms, have taken up the funding to upgrade their capabilities either in terms of how you manage cases, or how you manage the firm.

<ol start="25">
<li> A follow-up programme to build on what Tech Start for Law has achieved is now being planned with a view to:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>Offering the baseline technologies adopted during the first round of funding to those firms which have not had the chance to obtain funding; and </li>
<li>Firms adopting more sophisticated products such as AI-powered solutions that can assist in freeing up lawyers to do more high-value work as I alluded to earlier. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="26"}
26. Second, to look at how we can grow the pie for firms in Singapore and how we can make Singapore more attractive as a legal destination for people to come in to do legal work, not just disputes, but also negotiations, deals – essentially, how we can make the environment a lot more suitable for enterprises.

 
{:start="27"}
27. Asia is the world’s fastest growing economy. ASEAN is the world’s 6th largest economy today and projected to be the 4th largest by 2030.  So we have a 10 to12 year window for ASEAN to be the fourth largest economy, and with it come the opportunities.  Not very far away, India and China remain large jurisdictions that we cannot ignore – they are projected to see an average of 6% growth every year until at least 2022.

 
{:start="28"}
28. We in Singapore are fortunate to be in the epicentre of this growth and strategically placed to capture the demand for legal services that will inevitably come. Lawyers, all of us in this room, must be prepared to take the opportunity to advance, to grow out of their comfort zone and to seize and embrace those opportunities.

<ol start="29">
<li> There are several simultaneous efforts taking place. I will share a few examples:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We worked closely with the Law Society on Lawyers Go Global, and then IE Singapore. We launched this in February 2018 to help lawyers expand their networks and promote the Singapore Lawyer brand overseas. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Singapore lawyers have under this umbrella programme, been to places like Sri Lanka, China, Japan – markets that we see opportunities in, to not just raise awareness of Singapore as a jurisdiction, but to also enhance people-to-people relationships that lawyers have with people in those jurisdictions.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Engaging key legal markets. As I had mentioned, China is one of them. With their growing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) initiatives, this will become a great opportunity. The entirety of projects lined up in the BRI scheme is valued upwards of US$4 trillion. With many jurisdictions viewing us favourably as a neutral ground where they can resolve their disputes, we do stand a good chance of capturing this BRI work and we are working on that.  What do we have? A strong rule of law, a progressive system that is neutral and fair, trusted and familiar. These are all ingredients that we can continue to hold up as investors come into China, India and the rest of ASEAN. We can offer ourselves as services relying on these values and bringing work into Singapore.

</li>
