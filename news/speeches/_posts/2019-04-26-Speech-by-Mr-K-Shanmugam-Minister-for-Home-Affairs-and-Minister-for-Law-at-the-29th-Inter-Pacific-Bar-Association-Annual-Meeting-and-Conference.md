<u>Introduction</u>


First, congratulations to the IPBA who have put together this very well-organised conference with one of the largest turn-out you all ever had. We extend a warm welcome to our guests from all over the world, but most especially, our distinguished Plenary Guest-of-Honour from Malaysia, President of PKR (Parti Keadilan Rakyat).
